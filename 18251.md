This Superbook uses many letters with macrons (straight line above vowel):

ā ē ī ō ū ȳ   Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū

Other combined forms occur much less often, and may be disregarded so long as the macrons display correctly:

ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ (single letter with breve)  
o͝o (“oo” with breve)  
ē̆ (“e” with combined breve and macron)  
ā́ ī́ ṓ   ắ ĕ́ ĭ́ ŏ́ ŭ́ (letters with combined breve/macron and accent, used only in Pronunciation section)

_Note that most accents will correctly appear aftera letter:_

īn´sula, ha´bitat, illī´us

The variation between “æ” (English text) and “ae” (Latin text) is as in the original.

#### PREFACE

To make the course preparatory to Cæsar at the same time systematic, thorough, clear, and interesting is the purpose of this series of lessons.

The first pages are devoted to a brief discussion of the Latin language, its history, and its educational value. The body of the book, consisting of seventy-nine lessons, is divided into three parts.

## Part I is devoted to pronunciation, quantity, accent, and kindred introductory essentials.

## Part II carries the work through the first sixty lessons, and is devoted to the study of forms and vocabulary, together with some elementary constructions, a knowledge of which is necessary for the translation of the exercises and reading matter. The first few lessons have been made unusually simple, to meet the wants of pupils not well grounded in English grammar.

## Part III contains nineteen lessons, and is concerned primarily with the study of syntax and of subjunctive and irregular verb forms. The last three of these lessons constitute a review of all the constructions presented in the book. There is abundant easy reading matter; and, in order to secure proper concentration of effort upon syntax and translation, no new vocabularies are introduced, but the vocabularies in Part II are reviewed.

It is hoped that the following features will commend themselves to teachers:

The forms are presented in their natural sequence, and are given, for the most part, in the body of the book as well as in a grammatical appendix. The work on the verb is intensive in character, work in other directions being reduced to a minimum while this is going on. The forms of the subjunctive are studied in correlation with the subjunctive constructions.

vi The vocabulary has been selected with the greatest care, using Lodge’s “Dictionary of Secondary Latin” and Browne’s “Latin Word List” as a basis. There are about six hundred words, exclusive of proper names, in the special vocabularies, and these are among the simplest and commonest words in the language. More than ninety-five per cent of those chosen are Cæsarian, and of these more than ninety per cent are used in Cæsar five or more times. The few words not Cæsarian are of such frequent occurrence in Cicero, Vergil, and other authors as to justify their appearance here. But teachers desiring to confine word study to Cæsar can easily do so, as the Cæsarian words are printed in the vocabularies in distinctive type. Concrete nouns have been preferred to abstract, root words to compounds and derivatives, even when the latter were of more frequent occurrence in Cæsar. To assist the memory, related English words are added in each special vocabulary. To insure more careful preparation, the special vocabularies have been removed from their respective lessons and placed by themselves. The general vocabulary contains about twelve hundred words, and of these above eighty-five per cent are found in Cæsar.

The syntax has been limited to those essentials which recent investigations, such as those of Dr. Lee Byrne and his collaborators, have shown to belong properly to the work of the first year. The constructions are presented, as far as possible, from the standpoint of English, the English usage being given first and the Latin compared or contrasted with it. Special attention has been given to the constructions of participles, the gerund and gerundive, and the infinitive in indirect statements. Constructions having a logical connection are not separated but are treated together.

Exercises for translation occur throughout, those for translation into Latin being, as a rule, only half as long as those for translation into English. In Part III a few of the commoner idioms in Cæsar are introduced and the sentences are drawn mainly from that author. From first to last a consistent effort is made to instill a proper regard for Latin word order, the first principles of which are laid down early in the course.

vii Selections for reading are unusually abundant and are introduced from the earliest possible moment. These increase in number and length as the book progresses, and, for the most part, are made an integral part of the lessons instead of being massed at the end of the book. This arrangement insures a more constant and thorough drill in forms and vocabulary, promotes reading power, and affords a breathing spell between succeeding subjects. The material is drawn from historical and mythological sources, and the vocabulary employed includes but few words not already learned. The book closes with a continued story which recounts the chief incidents in the life of a Roman boy. The last chapters record his experiences in Cæsar’s army, and contain much information that will facilitate the interpretation of the Commentaries. The early emphasis placed on word order and sentence structure, the simplicity of the syntax, and the familiarity of the vocabulary, make the reading selections especially useful for work in sight translation.

Reviews are called for at frequent intervals, and to facilitate this branch of the work an Appendix of Reviews has been prepared, covering both the vocabulary and the grammar.

The illustrations are numerous, and will, it is hoped, do much to stimulate interest in the ancient world and to create true and lasting impressions of Roman life and times.

A consistent effort has been made to use simple language and clear explanation throughout.

As an aid to teachers using this book a “Teacher’s Manual” has been prepared, which contains, in addition to general suggestions, notes on each lesson.

The author wishes to express his gratitude to the numerous teachers who tested the advance pages in their classes, and, as a result of their experience, have given much valuable aid by criticism and suggestion. Particular acknowledgments are due to Miss A. Susan Jones of the Central High School, Grand Rapids, Michigan; to Miss Clara Allison of the High School at Hastings, Michigan; and to Miss Helen B. Muir and Mr. Orland O. Norris, teachers of Latin in this institution.

#### TO THE STUDENT—BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION

##### What is Latin? 

If you will look at the map of Italy on the opposite page, you will find near the middle of the peninsula and facing the west coast a district called Latium,1 and Rome its capital. The Latin language, meaning the language of Latium, was spoken by the ancient Romans and other inhabitants of Latium, and Latin was the name applied to it after the armies of Rome had carried the knowledge of her language far beyond its original boundaries. As the English of to-day is not quite the same as that spoken two or three hundred years ago, so Latin was not always the same at all times, but changed more or less in the course of centuries. The sort of Latin you are going to learn was in use about two thousand years ago. And that period has been selected because the language was then at its best and the greatest works of Roman literature were being produced. This period, because of its supreme excellence, is called the Golden Age of Roman letters.

1\. Pronounce _Lā´shĭ-ŭm_.

The Spread of Latin. For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors. But after the third century before Christ, Rome’s power grew rapidly. She conquered all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world. The empire thus established lasted for more than four 2 hundred years. The importance of Latin increased with the growth of Roman power, and what had been a dialect spoken by a single tribe became the universal language. Gradually the language changed somewhat, developing differently in different countries. In Italy it has become Italian, in Spain Spanish, and in France French. All these nations, therefore, are speaking a modernized form of Latin.

The Romans and the Greeks.In their career of conquest the Romans came into conflict with the Greeks. The Greeks were inferior to the Romans in military power, but far superior to them in culture. They excelled in art, literature, music, science, and philosophy. Of all these pursuits the Romans were ignorant until contact with Greece revealed to them the value of education and filled them with the thirst for knowledge. And so it came about that while Rome conquered Greece by force of arms, Greece conquered Rome by force of her intellectual superiority and became her schoolmaster. It was soon the established custom for young Romans to go to Athens and to other centers of Greek learning to finish their training, and the knowledge of the Greek language among the educated classes became universal. At the same time many cultured Greeks—poets, artists, orators, and philosophers—flocked to Rome, opened schools, and taught their arts. Indeed, the preëminence of Greek culture became so great that Rome almost lost her ambition to be original, and her writers vied with each other in their efforts to reproduce in Latin what was choicest in Greek literature. As a consequence of all this, the civilization and national life of Rome became largely Grecian, and to Greece she owed her literature and her art.

Rome and the Modern World.After conquering the world, Rome impressed her language, laws, customs of living, and modes of thinking upon the subject nations, and they became Roman; and the world has remained largely Roman ever since. Latin continued to live, and the knowledge of Latin was the only light of learning that burned steadily through the dark ages that followed the downfall of the Roman Empire. Latin was the common language of scholars and remained so even down to the days of Shakespeare. Even yet it is 3 more nearly than any other tongue the universal language of the learned. The life of to-day is much nearer the life of ancient Rome than the lapse of centuries would lead one to suppose. You and I are Romans still in many ways, and if Cæsar and Cicero should appear among us, we should not find them, except for dress and language, much unlike men of to-day.

Latin and English.Do you know that more than half of the words in the English dictionary are Latin, and that you are speaking more or less Latin every day? How has this come about? In the year 1066 William the Conqueror invaded England with an army of Normans. The Normans spoke French—which, you remember, is descended from Latin—and spread their language to a considerable extent over England, and so Norman-French played an important part in the formation of English and forms a large proportion of our vocabulary. Furthermore, great numbers of almost pure Latin words have been brought into English through the writings of scholars, and every new scientific discovery is marked by the addition of new terms of Latin derivation. Hence, while the simpler and commoner words of our mother tongue are Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon forms the staple of our colloquial language, yet in the realms of literature, and especially in poetry, words of Latin derivation are very abundant. Also in the learned professions, as in law, medicine, and engineering, a knowledge of Latin is necessary for the successful interpretation of technical and scientific terms.

##### Why study Latin? 

The foregoing paragraphs make it clear why Latin forms so important a part of modern education. We have seen that our civilization rests upon that of Greece and Rome, and that we must look to the past if we would understand the present. It is obvious, too, that the knowledge of Latin not only leads to a more exact and effective use of our own language, but that it is of vital importance and of great practical value to any one preparing for a literary or professional career. To this it may be added that the study of Latin throws a flood of light upon the structure of language in general and lays an excellent foundation for all grammatical study. 4 Finally, it has been abundantly proved that there is no more effective means of strengthening the mind than by the earnest pursuit of this branch of learning.
- Review Questions. 

Whence does Latin get its name? Where is Latium? Where is Rome? Was Latin always the same? What sort of Latin are we to study? Describe the growth of Rome’s power and the spread of Latin. What can you say of the origin of Italian, French, and Spanish? How did the ancient Greeks and Romans compare? How did Greece influence Rome? How did Rome influence the world? In what sense are we Romans still? What did Latin have to do with the formation of English? What proportion of English words are of Latin origin, and what kind of words are they? Why should we study Latin?

#### THE PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN

```
THE ALPHABET

1. The Latin alphabet contains the same letters as the English except that it has no _w_ and no _j_.

2. The vowels, as in English, are _a, e, i, o, u, y_. The other letters are consonants.

3. _I_ is used both as a vowel and as a consonant. Before a vowel in the same syllable it has the value of a consonant and is called _I consonant_.

Thus in Iū-li-us the first _i_ is a consonant, the second a vowel.
```

##### SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS

1\. N.B. The sounds of the letters are best learned by hearing them correctly pronounced. The matter in this section is, therefore, intended for reference rather than for assignment as a lesson. As a first step it is suggested that the teacher pronounce the examples in class, the pupils following.

4\. Latin was not pronounced like English. The Romans at the beginning of the Christian era pronounced their language substantially as described below.

5\. The vowels have the following sounds:

Vowels2

Latin Examples

ā as in _father_

ă like the first _a_ in _aha´_, never as in _hat_

hāc, stās  
ă´-măt, că-nās

ē as in _they_  
ĕ as in _met_

tē´-lă, mē´-tă  
tĕ´-nĕt, mĕr´-cēs

ī as in _machine_  
6 ĭ as in _bit_

sĕr´-tī, prā´-tī  
sĭ´-tĭs, bĭ´-bī

ō as in _holy_  
ŏ as in _wholly_, never as in _hot_

Rō´-mă, ō´-rĭs  
mŏ´-dŏ, bŏ´-nōs

ū as in _rude_, or as _oo_ in _boot_

ŭ as in _full_, or as _oo_ in _foot_

ū´-mŏr, tū´-bĕr  
ŭt, tū´-tŭs

2\. Long vowels are marked ¯, short ones ˘.

Note. It is to be observed that there is a decided difference in sound, except in the case of _a_, between the long and the short vowels. It is not merely a matter of _quantity_ but also of _quality_.

6\. In diphthongs(two-vowel sounds) both vowels are heard in a single syllable.

Diphthongs

Latin Examples

ae\. as _ai_ in _aisle_  
au\. as _ou_ in _out_

tae´-dae  
gau´-dĕt

ei\. as _ei_ in _eight_

eu\. as _ĕ´o͝o_ (a short _e_ followed by a short _u_ in one syllable)

dein´-dĕ  
seu

oe\. like _oi_ in _toil_

ui\. like _o͝o´ĭ_ (a short _u_ followed by a short _i_ in one syllable. Cf. English _we_)

foe´-dŭs  
cui, huic

Note. Give all the vowels and diphthongs their proper sounds and do not slur over them in unaccented syllables, as is done in English.

Consonants are pronounced as in English, except that

Consonants

Latin Examples

c\. is always like _c_ in _cat_, never as in _cent_

g\. is always like _g_ in _get_, never as in _gem_
- i consonantis always like _y_ in _yes_

n\. before _c, qu_, or _g_ is like _ng_ in _sing_ (compare the sound of _n_ in _anchor_)

că´-dō, cĭ´-bŭs, cē´-nă  
gĕ´-mō, gĭg´-nō  
iăm, iŏ´-cŭs  
ăn´-cŏ-ră (ang´-ko-ra)

qu\., gu, and sometimes subefore a vowel have the sound of _qw, gw_, and _sw_. Here _u_ has the value of consonant _v_ and is not counted a vowel

ĭn´-quĭt, quī, lĭn´-guă, săn´-guĭs, suā´-dĕ-ō

s\. is like _s_ in _sea_, never as in _ease_

t\. is always like _t_ in _native_, never as in _nation_

rŏ´-să, ĭs  
ră´-tĭ-ō, nā´-tĭ-ō

v\. is like _w_ in _wine_, never as in _vine_

x\. has the value of two consonants (_cs_ or _gs_) and is like _x_ in _extract_, not as in _exact_

vī´-nŭm, vĭr  
ĕx´-trā, ĕx-āc´-tŭs

bs\. is like _ps_ and btlike _pt_

ch\., ph, and thare like _c_, _p_, _t_

ŭrbs, ŏb-tĭ´-nĕ-ō  

pŭl´-chĕr, Phoe´-bē, thĕ-ā´-trŭm

_a._ In combinations of consonants give each its distinct sound. Doubled consonants should be pronounced with a slight pause between the two sounds. Thus pronounce _tt_ as in _rat-trap_, not as in _rattle_; _pp_ as in _hop-pole_, not as in _upper_. Examples, mĭt´-tō, Ăp´pĭ-ŭs, bĕl´-lŭm.

##### SYLLABLES

8\. A Latin word has as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs. Thus aes-tā´-tĕhas three syllables, au-dĭ-ĕn´-dŭshas four.

_a._ Two vowels with a consonant between them never make one syllable, as is so often the case in English. Compare English _inside_ with Latin īn-sī´-dĕ.

9\. Words are divided into syllables as follows:

1\. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second. Thus ă-mā´-bĭ-lĭs, mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ă, ĭn-tĕ´-rĕ-ā, ă´-bĕst, pĕ-rē´-gĭt.3

3\. In writing and printing it is customary to divide the parts of a compound, as inter-eā, ab-est, sub-āctus, per-ēgit, contrary to the correct phonetic rule.

2\. Combinations of two or more consonants:

_a._ A consonant followed by _l_ or _r_ goes with the _l_ or _r_. Thus pū´-blĭ-cŭs, ă´-grī.

Exception. Prepositional compounds of this nature, as also _ll_ and _rr_, follow rule _b_. Thus ăb´-lŭ-ō, ăb-rŭm´-pō, ĭl´-lĕ, fĕr´-rŭm.

_b._ In all other combinations of consonants the first consonant goes with the preceding vowel.4 Thus măg´-nŭs, ĕ-gĕs´-tās, vĭc-tō´-rĭ-ă, hŏs´-pĕs, ăn´-nŭs, sŭ-bāc´-tŭs.

4\. The combination nctis divided nc-t, as fūnc-tŭs, sānc-tŭs.

3\. The last syllable of a word is called the _ul´-ti-ma_; the one next to the last, the _pe-nult´_; the one before the penult, the _an´-te-pe-nult´_.

8 10.EXERCISE

Divide the words in the following passage into syllables and pronounce them, placing the accent as indicated:

Vā́dĕ ăd fŏrmī́căm, Ō pĭ́gĕr, ĕt cōnsī́dĕrā vĭ́ās ĕ́iŭs ĕt dĭ́scĕ săpĭĕ́ntĭăm: quae cŭm nōn hắbĕăt dŭ́cĕm nĕc praecĕptṓrĕm nĕc prī́ncĭpĕm, pắrăt ĭn aestā́tĕ cĭ́bŭm sĭ́bĭ ĕt cŏ́ngrĕgăt ĭn mĕ́ssĕ quŏd cŏ́mĕdăt.

\[Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: which, having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest.\]

##### QUANTITY

11\. The quantity of a vowel or a syllable is the time it takes to pronounce it. Correct pronunciation and accent depend upon the proper observance of quantity.

Quantity of Vowels.Vowels are either long (¯) or short (˘). In this book the long vowels are marked. Unmarked vowels are to be considered short.

1\. A vowel is short before another vowel or _h_; as pŏ-ē´-ta, tră´-hō.

2\. A vowel is short before _nt_ and _nd_, before final _m_ or _t_, and, except in words of one syllable, before final _l_ or _r_. Thus a´-mănt, a-măn´-dus, a-mā´-băm, a-mā´-băt, a´-ni-măl, a´-mŏr.

3\. A vowel is long before _nf_, _ns_, _nx_, and _nct_. Thus īn´-fe-rō, re´-gēns, sān´-xī, sānc´-tus.

4\. Diphthongs are always long, and are not marked.

Quantity of Syllables.Syllables are either long or short, and their quantity must be carefully distinguished from that of vowels.

1\. A syllable is short,

_a._ If it ends in a short vowel; as ă´-mō, pĭ´-grĭ.

Note. In final syllables the short vowel may be followed by a final consonant. Thus the word mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ămcontains four short syllables. In the first three a short vowel ends the syllable, in the last the short vowel is followed by a final consonant.

9 2\. A syllable is long,

_a._ If it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, as cū´-rō, poe´-nae, aes-tā´-te.

_b._ If it ends in a consonant which is followed by another consonant, as cor´-pus, mag´-nus.

Note. The vowel in a long syllable may be either long or short, and should be pronounced accordingly. Thus in ter´-ra, in´-ter, the first syllable is long, but the vowel in each case is short and should be given the short sound. In words like saxumthe first syllable is long because _x_ has the value of two consonants (_cs_ or _gs_).

3\. In determining quantity _h_ is not counted a consonant.

Note. Give about twice as much time to the long syllables as to the short ones. It takes about as long to pronounce a short vowel plus a consonant as it does to pronounce a long vowel or a diphthong, and so these quantities are considered equally long. For example, it takes about as long to say cŭr´-rōas it does cū´-rō, and so each of these first syllables is long. Compare mŏl´-lisand mō´-lis, ā-mĭs´-sīand ā-mi´-sī.

##### ACCENT

14\. Words of two syllables are accented on the first, as mēn´-sa, Cae´-sar.

15\. Words of more than two syllables are accented on the penult if the penult is long. If the penult is short, accent the antepenult. Thus mo-nē´-mus, re´-gi-tur, a-gri´-co-la, a-man´-dus.

Note. Observe that the position of the accent is determined by the length of the _syllable_ and not by the length of the vowel in the syllable. (Cf. [§ 13. 2](#sec13), Note.)

16\. Certain little words called _enclit´ics_5 which have no separate existence, are added to and pronounced with a preceding word. The most common are \-que, _and_; \-ve, _or_; and \-ne, the question sign. The syllable before an enclitic takes the accent, regardless of its quantity. Thus populus´que, dea´que, rēgna´ve, audit´ne.

5\. Enclitic means _leaning back_, and that is, as you see, just what these little words do. They cannot stand alone and so they lean back for support upon the preceding word.

##### HOW TO READ LATIN

17\. To read Latin well is not so difficult, if you begin right. Correct habits of reading should be formed now. Notice the quantities carefully, especially the quantity of the penult, to insure your getting the accent on the right syllable. (Cf. [§ 15](#sec15).) Give every vowel its proper sound and every syllable its proper length. Then bear in mind that we should read Latin as we read English, in phrases rather than in separate words. Group together words that are closely connected in thought. No good reader halts at the end of each word.

18\. Read the stanzas of the following poem by Longfellow, one at a time, first the English and then the Latin version. The syllables inclosed in parentheses are to be slurred or omitted to secure smoothness of meter.

##### EXCELSIOR \[HIGHER\]! 6

```
The shades of night were falling fast,  
As through an Alpine village passed  
A youth, who bore, ’mid snow and ice,  
A banner with the strange device,

His brow was sad; his eye beneath,  
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,  
And like a silver clarion rung  
The accents of that unknown tongue,  
Excelsior!

In happy homes he saw the light  
Of household fires gleam warm and bright;  
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,  
And from his lips escaped a groan,  
Excelsior!

“Try not the Pass!” the old man said;  
“Dark lowers the tempest overhead,  
11 The roaring torrent is deep and wide!”  
And loud that clarion voice replied,  
Excelsior!

A traveler, by the faithful hound,  
Half-buried in the snow was found,  
Still grasping in his hand of ice  
That banner with the strange device,

There in the twilight cold and gray,  
Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay,  
And from the sky, serene and far,  
A voice fell, like a falling star,  
Excelsior!

Iacet corpus exanimum  
Sed lūce frīgidā pulchrum;  
Et caelō procul exiēns

WORDS AND FORMS

    LESSON I

FIRST PRINCIPLES
```

Subject and Predicate.1. Latin, like English, expresses thoughts by means of sentences. A sentence is a combination of words that expresses a thought, and in its simplest form is the statement of a single fact. Thus,

_Galba is a farmer_  
> Galba est agricola

_The sailor fights_  - Nauta pugnat

In each of these sentences there are two parts:

Subject

_Galba_  - Galba 

_The sailor_  - Nauta

Predicate

_is a farmer_  - est agricola 

_fights_  - pugnat

2\. The subject is that person, place, or thing about which something is said, and is therefore a _noun_ or some word which can serve the same purpose.

_a._ Pronouns, as their name implies (_pro_, “instead of,” and _noun_), often take the place of nouns, usually to save repeating the same noun, as, _Galba is a farmer; heis a sturdy fellow_.

3\. The predicate is that which is said about the subject, and consists of a verb with or without modifiers.

_a._ A verb is a word which asserts something (usually an act) concerning a person, place, or thing.

13 20.

The Object.In the two sentences, _The boy hit the ball_ and _The ball hit the boy_, the same words are used, but the meaning is different, and depends upon the order of the words. The doerof the act, that about which something is said, is, as we have seen above, the subject. That to which something is doneis the direct objectof the verb. _The boy hit the ball_ is therefore analyzed as follows:

Subject

Predicate

_The boy_

_hit the ball_  
(verb) (direct object)

_a._ A verb whose action passes over to the object directly, as in the sentence above, is called a transitive verb. A verb which does not admit of a direct object is called intransitive, as, _I walk, he comes_.

The Copula.The verb _to be_ in its different forms—_are_, _is_, _was_, etc.—does not tell us anything about the subject; neither does it govern an object. It simply connects the subject with the word or words in the predicate that possess a distinct meaning. Hence it is called the copula, that is, _the joiner_ or _link_.

22\. In the following sentences pronounce the Latin and name the _nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, predicates, copulas_:

1. America est patria mea 
_America is fatherland my_

2. Agricola fīliam amat 
_(The) farmer (his) daughter loves_

3. Fīlia est Iūlia 
_(His) daughter is Julia_

4. Iūlia et agricola sunt in īnsulā 
_Julia and (the) farmer are on (the) island_

5. Iūlia aquam portat 
_Julia water carries_

6. Rosam in comīs habet 
_(A) rose in (her) hair (she) has_

7. Iūlia est puella pulchra 
_Julia is (a) girl pretty_

8. Domina fīliam pulchram habet 
_(The) lady (a) daughter beautiful has_

_a._ The sentences above show that Latin does not express some words which are necessary in English. First of all, _Latin has no article theor a_; thus _agricola_ may mean _the farmer, a farmer_, or simply _farmer_. Then, too, the personal pronouns, _I, you, he, she_, etc., and the possessive pronouns, _my, your, his, her_, etc., are not expressed if the meaning of the sentence is clear without them.

Inflection. Words may change their forms to indicate some change in sense or use, as, _is, are; was, were; who, whose, whom; farmer, farmer’s; woman, women_. This is called inflection. The inflection of a noun, adjective, or pronoun is called its declension, that of a verb its conjugation.

Number. Latin, like English, has two numbers, singular and plural. In English we usually form the plural by adding _\-s_ or _\-es_ to the singular. So Latin changes the singular to the plural by changing the ending of the word. Compare
- Naut-a pugnat 
_The sailor fights_
- Naut-ae pugnant 
_The sailors fight_

25\. Rule. _Nouns that end in \-ain the singular end in \-aein the plural_.

26\. Learn the following nouns so that you can give the English for the Latin or the Latin for the English. Write the plural of each.
- agri´cola, _farmer_ (agriculture)1  
aqua\., _water_ (aquarium)  
causa\., _cause, reason_
- do´mina, _lady of the house, mistress_ (dominate)

filia\., _daughter_ (filial)  - fortū´na, _fortune_

fuga\., _flight_ (fugitive)  - iniū´ria, _wrong, injury_  - lūna, _moon_ (lunar)  
nauta\., _sailor_ (nautical)  - puel´la, _girl_  
silva\., forest (silvan)  
terra\., _land_ (terrace)

1\. The words in parentheses are English words related to the Latin. When the words are practically identical, as causa, _cause_, no comparison is needed.

27\. Compare again the sentences
- Nauta pugna-t 
_The sailor fights_
- Nautae pugna-nt 
_The sailors fight_

In the first sentence the verb pugna-tis in the third person singular, in the second sentence pugna-ntis in the third person plural.

> Rule. Agreement of Verb._A finite verb must always be in the same person and number as its subject._

29\. Rule. _In the conjugation of the Latin verb the third person singular active ends in \-t, the third person plural in \-nt. The endings which show the person and number of the verb are called personal endings._

30\. Learn the following verbs and write the plural of each. The personal pronouns _he_, _she_, _it_, etc., which are necessary in the inflection of the English verb, are not needed in the Latin, because the personal endings take their place. Of course, if the verb’s subject is expressed we do not translate the personal ending by a pronoun; thus nauta pugnatis translated _the sailor fights_, not _the sailor he fights_.
- ama-t

_he (she, it)_

_loves, is loving, does love_ (amity, amiable)
- labō´ra-t

_labors, is laboring, does labor_
- nūntia-t2

_announces, is announcing, does announce_
- porta-t

_carries, is carrying, does carry_ (porter)
- pugna-t

_fights, is fighting, does fight_ (pugnacious)

2\. The _u_ in nūntiōis long by exception. (Cf. [§ 12. 2](#sec12).)

31\. EXERCISES

---

1. The daughter loves, the daughters love. 

2. The sailor is carrying, the sailors carry. 3. The farmer does labor, the farmers labor. 4. The girl is announcing, the girls do announce. 5. The ladies are carrying, the lady carries.

##### LESSON III

###### FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)

Declension of Nouns.We learned above ([§§ 19](#sec19), [20](#sec20)) the difference between the subject and object, and that in English they may be distinguished by the order of the words. Sometimes, however, the order is such that we are left in doubt. For example, the sentence _The lady her daughter loves_ might mean either that the lady loves her daughter, or that the daughter loves the lady.

1\. If the sentence were in Latin, no doubt could arise, because the subject and the object are distinguished, not by the order of the words, but by the endings of the words themselves. Compare the following sentences:
- Domina fīliam amat

Fīliam domina amat

Amat fīliam domina

Domina amat fīliam

The lady loves her daughter
- Fīlia dominam amat

Dominam fīlia amat

Amat dominam fīlia

Fīlia amat dominam

The daughter loves the lady

_a._ Observe that in each case the subject of the sentence ends in \-aand the object in \-am. The _form_ of the noun shows how it is used in the sentence, and the order of the words has no effect on the essential meaning.

2\. As stated above ([§ 23](#sec23)), this change of ending is called declension, and each different ending produces what is called a case. When we decline a noun, we give all its different cases, or changes of endings. In English we have three cases,—nominative, possessive, and objective; but, in nouns, the nominative and objective have the same form, and only the possessive case shows a change of ending, by adding _’s_ or the apostrophe. The interrogative pronoun, however, has the fuller declension, _who?_ _whose?_ _whom?_

17 33.The following table shows a comparison between English and Latin declension forms, and should be thoroughly memorized:

_c._ The accusative singular ends in \-amand the accusative plural in \-ās.

_d._ The genitive singular and the nominative plural have the same ending.

34\. EXERCISE

Pronounce the following words and give their general meaning. Then give the number and case, and the use of each form. Where the same form stands for more than one case, give all the possible cases and uses.

1\. Silva, silvās, silvam. 2. Fugam, fugae, fuga. 3. Terrārum, terrae, terrās. 4. Aquās, causam, lūnās. 5. Fīliae, fortūnae, lūnae. 6. Iniūriās, agricolārum, aquārum. 7. Iniūriārum, agricolae, puellās. 8. Nautam, agricolās, nautās. 9. Agricolam, puellam, silvārum.

##### LESSON IV

###### FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)

35\. We learned from the table ([§ 33](#sec33)) that the Latin nominative, genitive, and accusative correspond, in general, to the nominative, possessive, and objective in English, and that they are used in the same way. This will be made even clearer by the following sentence:
- Fīlia agricolae nautam amat,  
_the farmer’s daughter_ (or _the daughter of the farmer_) _loves the sailor_

What is the subject? the direct object? What case is used for the subject? for the direct object? What word denotes the possessor? In what case is it?

36\. Rule. Nominative Subject._The subject of a finite verb is in the Nominative and answers the question Who? or What?_

37\. Rule. Accusative Object._The direct object of a transitive verb is in the Accusative and answers the question Whom? or What?_

38\. Rule. Genitive of the Possessor._The word denoting the owner or possessor of something is in the Genitive and answers the question Whose?_

6\. Cuius fīliae labōrant?

##### LESSON V

###### FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)

The Dative Case.In addition to the relationships between words expressed by the nominative, genitive (possessive), and accusative (objective) cases, there are other relationships, to express which in English we use such words as _from_, _with_, _by_, _to_, _for_, _in_, _at_.1

1\. Words like _to_, _for_, _by_, _from_, _in_, etc., which define the relationship between words, are called prepositions.

Latin, too, makes frequent use of such prepositions; but often it expresses these relations without them by means of case forms which 20 English does not possess. One of the cases found in the Latin declension and lacking in English is called the _dative_.

42\. When the nominative singular ends in \-a, the dative singular ends in \-aeand the dative plural in \-īs.

Note. Observe that the _genitive singular_, the _dative singular_, and the _nominative plural_ all have the same ending, \-ae; but the uses of the three cases are entirely different. The general meaning of the sentence usually makes clear which case is intended.

_a._ Form the dative singular and plural of the following nouns: fuga, causa, fortūna, terra, aqua, puella, agricola, nauta, domina.

The Dative Relation.The dative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions _to_, _towards_, _for_.

These prepositions are often used in English in expressions of motion, such as _She went to town_, _He ran towards the horse_, _Columbus sailed for America_. In such cases the dative is not used in Latin, as _motion through space_ is foreign to the dative relation. But the dative is used to denote that _to_ or _towards which_ a benefit, injury, purpose, feeling, or quality is directed, or that _for which_ something serves or exists.

_a._ What dative relations do you discover in the following?

The teacher gave a prize to John because he replied so promptly to all her questions—a good example for the rest of us. It is a pleasure to us to hear him recite. Latin is easy for him, but it is very hard for me. Some are fitted for one thing and others for another.

The Indirect Object.Examine the sentence
- Nauta fugam nūntiat, _the sailor announces the flight_

Here the verb, nūntiat, governs the direct object, fugam, in the accusative case. If, however, we wish to mention the persons to whomthe sailor announces the flight, as, _The sailor announces the flight to the farmers_, the verb will have two objects:

1\. Its direct object, _flight_ (fugam)

2\. Its indirect object, _farmers_

According to the preceding section, _to the farmers_ is a relation covered by the dative case, and we are prepared for the following rule:

21 45.Rule. Dative Indirect Object._The indirect object of a verb is in the Dative._

_a._ The indirect object usually stands before the direct object.

46\. We may now complete the translation of the sentence _The sailor announces the flight to the farmers_, and we have
- Nauta agricolīs fugam nūntiat

47. EXERCISES

#### I. 1. Quis nautīs pecūniam dat? 2. Fīliae agricolae nautīs pecūniam dant. 3. Quis fortūnam pugnae nūntiat? 4. Galba agricolīs fortunam pugnae nūntiat. 5. Cui domina fābulam nārrat? 6. Fīliae agricolae domina fābulam nārrat. 7. Quis Diānae corōnam dat? 8. Puella Diānae corōnam dat quia Diānam amat. 9. Dea lūnae sagittās portat et ferās silvārum necat. 10. Cuius victōriam Galba nūntiat? 11. Nautae victōriam Galba nūntiat.

Imitate the word order of the preceding exercise.

---

#### II. 1. To whom do the girls give a wreath? 2. The girls give a wreath to Julia, because Julia loves wreaths. 3. The sailors tell the ladies2 a story, because the ladies love stories. 4. The farmer gives his ([§ 22. _a_](#sec22)) daughter water. 5. Galba announces the cause of the battle to the sailor. 6. The goddess of the moon loves the waters of the forest. 7. Whose wreath is Latona carrying? Diana’s.

2\. Observe that in English the indirect object often stands without a preposition _to_ to mark it, especially when it precedes the direct object.

##### LESSON VI

###### FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)

The Ablative Case.Another case, lacking in English but found in the fuller Latin declension, is the _ab´la-tive._

49\. When the nominative singular ends in \-a, the ablative singular ends in \-āand the ablative plural in \-īs.

_a._ Observe that the final -ă of the nominative is short, while the final -ā of the ablative is long, as,

_Nom._ fīliă

_Abl._ fīliā

_b._ Observe that the ablative plural is like the dative plural.

_c._ Form the ablative singular and plural of the following nouns: fuga, causa, fortūna, terra, aqua, puella, agricola, nauta, domina.

The Ablative Relation.The ablative case is used to express the relations conveyed in English by the prepositions _from_, _with_, _by_, _at_, _in_. It denotes

1\. That from which something is separated, from which it starts, or of which it is deprived—generally translated by _from_.

2\. That with which something is associated or by means of which it is done—translated by _with_ or _by_.

3\. The place where or the time when something happens—translated by _in_ or _at_.

_a._ What ablative relations do you discover in the following?

In our class there are twenty boys and girls. Daily at eight o’clock they come from home with their books, and while they are at school they study Latin with great zeal. In a short time they will be able to read with ease the books written by the Romans. By patience and perseverance all things in this world can be overcome.

Prepositions. While, as stated above ([§ 41](#sec41)), many relations expressed in English by prepositions are in Latin expressed by case forms, still prepositions are of frequent occurrence, but only with the accusative or ablative.

23 52.Rule. Object of a Preposition._A noun governed by a preposition must be in the Accusative or Ablative case._

53\. Prepositions denoting the ablative relations _from, with, in, on_, are naturally followed by the ablative case. Among these are
- ā1 or ab, _from, away from_
- dē, _from, down from_
- ē1 or ex, _from, out from, out of_

cum\., _with_

in\., _in, on_

1\. āand ēare used only before words beginning with a consonant; aband exare used before either vowels or consonants.

1\. _Translate into Latin, using prepositions._ In the water, on the land, down from the forest, with the fortune, out of the forests, from the victory, out of the waters, with the sailors, down from the moon.

Adjectives. Examine the sentence
- Puella parva bonam deam amat, _the little girl loves the good goddess_

In this sentence parva(_little_) and bonam(_good_) are not nouns, but are descriptive words expressing quality. Such words are called _adjectives_,2 and they are said to belong to the noun which they describe.

2\. _Pick out the adjectives in the following:_ “When I was a little boy, I remember that one cold winter’s morning I was accosted by a smiling man with an ax on his shoulder. ‘My pretty boy,’ said he, ‘has your father a grindstone?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said I. ‘You are a fine little fellow,’ said he. ‘Will you let me grind my ax on it?’”

You can tell by its ending to which noun an adjective belongs. The ending of parvashows that it belongs to puella, and the ending of bonamthat it belongs to deam. Words that belong together are said to agree, and the belonging-together is called _agreement_. Observe that _the adjective and its noun agree in number and case_.

55\. Examine the sentences
- Puella est parva, _the girl is little_
- Puella parva bonam deam amat, _the little girl loves the good goddess_

In the first sentence the adjective parvais separated from its noun by the verb and stands in the predicate. It is therefore called a _predicate adjective_. In the second sentence the adjectives parvaand 24 bonamare closely attached to the nouns puellaand deamrespectively, and are called _attributive adjectives._

_a._ Pick out the attributive and the predicate adjectives in the following:

Do you think Latin is hard? Hard studies make strong brains. Lazy students dislike hard studies. We are not lazy.

56\. DIALOGUE

##### Julia and Galba

---

#### I. Quis, Galba, est Diāna?  
G. Diāna, Iūlia, est pulchra dea lūnae et silvārum.  

---

#### I. Cuius fīlia, Galba, est Diāna?  
G. Lātōnae fīlia, Iūlia, est Diāna.  

---

#### I. Quid Diāna portat?  
G. Sagittās Diāna portat.  

---

#### I. Cūr Diāna sagittās portat?  
G. Diāna sagittās portat, Iūlia, quod malās ferās silvae magnae necat.  

---

#### I. Amatne Lātōna fīliam?  
G. Amat, et fīlia Lātōnam amat.  

---

#### I. Quid fīlia tua parva portat?  
G. Corōnās pulchrās fīlia mea parva portat.  

---

#### I. Cui fīlia tua corōnās pulchrās dat?  
G. Diānae corōnās dat.  

---

#### I. Quis est cum fīliā tuā? Estne sōla?  
G. Sōla nōn est; fīlia mea parva est cum ancillā meā.

_a._ When a person is called or addressed, the case used is called the _voc´ative_ (Latin _vocāre_, “to call”). _In form the vocative is regularly like the nominative_. In English the name of the person addressed usually stands first in the sentence. _The Latin vocative rarely stands first_. Point out five examples of the vocative in this dialogue.

_b._ Observe that questions answered by _yes_ or _no_ in English are answered in Latin by repeating the verb. Thus, if you wished to answer in Latin the question _Is the sailor fighting?_ Pugnatne nauta?you would say Pugnat, _he is fighting_, or Nōn pugnat, _he is not fighting._

##### LESSON VII

###### THE FIRST OR _Ā_\-DECLENSION

57\. In the preceding lessons we have now gone over all the cases, singular and plural, of nouns whose nominative singular ends in \-a. All Latin nouns whose nominative singular ends in \-abelong to the First Declension. It is also called the _Ā_\-Declension because of the prominent part which the vowel aplays in the formation of the cases. We have also learned what relations are expressed by each case. These results are summarized in the following table:

Case

Noun

Translation

Use and General Meaning of Each Case

Singular

_Nom._

do´min\-a

_the lady_

The subject

_Gen._

domin \-ae

_of the lady_, or _the lady’s_

The possessor of something

_Dat._

domin \-ae

_to_ or _for the lady_

Expressing the relation _to_ or _for_, especially the indirect object

_Acc._

domin \-am

_the lady_

The direct object

_Abl._

domin \-ā

_from, with, by, in, the lady_

Separation (_from_), association or means (_with, by_), place where or time when (_in, at_)

Plural

_Nom._

domin \-ae

_the ladies_

The same as the singular

_Gen._

domin \-ā´rum

_of the ladies_, or _the ladies’_

_Dat._

domin \-īs

_to_ or _for the ladies_

_Acc._

domin \-ās

_the ladies_

_Abl._

domin \-īs

_from, with, by, in, the ladies_

The Base.That part of a word which remains unchanged in inflection and to which the terminations are added is called the base.

Thus, in the declension above, domin-is the base and \-ais the termination of the nominative singular.

26 59.Write the declension of the following nouns, separating the base from the termination by a hyphen. Also give them orally.
- pugna, terra, lūna, ancil´la, corō´na, īn´sula, silva

60.

Gender. In English, names of living beings are either masculine or feminine, and names of things without life are neuter. This is called natural gender. Yet in English there are some names of things to which we refer as if they were feminine; as, “Have you seen my yacht? _She_ is a beauty.” And there are some names of living beings to which we refer as if they were neuter; as, “Is the baby here? No, the nurse has taken _it_ home.” Some words, then, have a gender quite apart from sex or real gender, and this is called grammatical gender.

Latin, like English, has three genders. Names of males are usually masculine and of females feminine, but _names of things have grammatical gender and may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter_. Thus we have in Latin the three words, lapis, _a stone_; rūpēs, _a cliff_; and saxum, _a rock_. Lapisis _masculine_, rūpēs_feminine_, and saxum_neuter_. The gender can usually be determined by the ending of the word, and _must always be learned_, for without knowing the gender it is impossible to write correct Latin.

Gender of First-Declension Nouns.Nouns of the first declension are feminine unless they denote males. Thus silvais feminine, but nauta, _sailor_, and agricola, _farmer_, are masculine.

##### LESSON VIII

###### FIRST DECLENSION (_Continued_)

64\. We have for some time now been using adjectives and nouns together and you have noticed an agreement between them in _case_ and in _number_ ([§ 54](#sec54)). They agree also in _gender_. In the phrase silva magna, we have a feminine adjective in \-aagreeing with a feminine noun in \-a.

65\. Rule. Agreement of Adjectives._Adjectives agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case._

66\. Feminine adjectives in \-aare declined like feminine nouns in \-a, and you should learn to decline them together as follows:

Latin Word Order.The order of words in English and in Latin sentences is not the same.

In English we arrange words in a fairly fixed order. Thus, in the sentence _My daughter is getting dinner for the farmers_, we cannot alter the order of the words without spoiling the sentence. We can, however, throw emphasis on different words by speaking them with more force. Try the effect of reading the sentence by putting special force on _my, daughter, dinner, farmers_.

In Latin, where the office of the word in the sentence is shown by its _ending_ (cf. [§ 32. 1](#sec32)), and not by its _position_, the order of words is more free, and position is used to secure the same effect that in English is secured by emphasis of voice. To a limited extent we can alter the order of words in English, too, for the same purpose. Compare the sentences

_I saw a game of football at Chicago last November_ (normal order)

_ Last NovemberI saw a game of football at Chicago_

_At Chicago, last November, I saw a game of football_

1\. In a Latin sentence the most emphatic place is the _first_; next in importance is the _last_; the weakest point is the _middle_. Generally the _subject_ is the most important word, and is placed _first_; usually the _verb_ is the next in importance, and is placed _last_. The other words of the sentence stand between these two in the order of their importance. Hence the normal order of words—that is, where no unusual emphasis is expressed—is as follows:
- _subject_—_modifiers of the subject_—_indirect object_—_direct object_—_adverb_—_verb_

Changes from the normal order are frequent, and are due to the desire for throwing emphasis upon some word or phrase. _Notice the order of the_ 30 _Latin words when you are translating, and imitate it when you are turning English into Latin._

2\. Possessive pronouns and modifying genitives normally stand after their nouns. When placed before their nouns they are emphatic, as fīlia mea, _my daughter_; mea fīlia, _mydaughter_; casa Galbae, _Galba’s cottage_; Galbae casa, _Galba’scottage_.

Notice the variety of emphasis produced by writing the following sentence in different ways:
- Fīlia mea agricolīs cēnam parat(normal order)
- Mea fīlia agricolīs parat cēnam(meaand cēnamemphatic)
- Agricolīs fīlia mea cēnam parat(agricolīsemphatic)

3\. An adjective placed before its noun is more emphatic than when it follows. When great emphasis is desired, the adjective is separated from its noun by other words.
- Fīlia mea casam parvam nōn amat(parvamnot emphatic)
- Fīlia mea parvam casam nōn amat(parvammore emphatic)
- Parvam fīlia mea casam nōn amat(parvamvery emphatic)

4\. Interrogative words usually stand first, the same as in English.

5\. The copula (as est, sunt) is of so little importance that it frequently does not stand last, but may be placed wherever it sounds well.

##### LESSON IX

###### THE SECOND OR _O_\-DECLENSION

70\. Latin nouns are divided into five declensions.

The declension to which a noun belongs is shown by the ending of the genitive singular. This should always be learned along with the nominative and the gender.

71\. The nominative singular of nouns of the Second or _O_\-Declension ends in \-us, \-er, \-ir, or \-um. The genitive singular ends in \-ī.

Gender. Nouns in \-umare neuter. The others are regularly masculine.

Declension of nouns in -_us_ and -_um_.Masculines in \-usand neuters in \-umare declined as follows:

dominus\. (base domin-), m., _master_
- pīlum(base pīl-), n., _spear_

Singular

1\. Compare the declension of dominaand of dominus.

_a._ Observe that the masculines and the neuters have the same terminations excepting in the nominative singular and the nominative and accusative plural.

_b._ The vocative singular of words of the second declension in \-usends in \-ĕ, as domine, _O master_; serve, _O slave_. This is the most important exception to the rule in [§ 56. _a_](#sec56).

74\. Write side by side the declension of domina, dominus, and pīlum. A comparison of the forms will lead to the following rules, which are of great importance because they apply to all five declensions:

_a._ The vocative, with a single exception (see [§ 73. _b_](#sec73)), is like the nominative. That is, the vocative singular is like the nominative singular, and the vocative plural is like the nominative plural.

_b._ The nominative, accusative, and vocative of neuter nouns are alike, and in the plural end in \-a.

_c._ The accusative singular of masculines and feminines ends in \-mand the accusative plural in \-s.

_d._ The dative and ablative plural are always alike.

_e._ Final \-iand \-oare always _long_; final \-ais _short_, except in the ablative singular of the first declension.

75\. Observe the sentences
- Lesbia est bona, _Lesbia is good_
- Lesbia est ancilla, _Lesbia is a maidservant_

We have learned ([§ 55](#sec55)) that bona, when used, as here, in the predicate to describe the subject, is called a _predicate adjective_. Similarly a _noun_, as ancilla, used in the _predicate_ to define the subject is called a predicate noun.

76\. Rule. Predicate Noun._A predicate noun agrees in case with the subject of the verb._

2. habitatis here translated _does live_. Note the _three_ possible translations of the Latin present tense:
- habitat

he lives  
he is living  
he does live

Always choose the translation which makes the best sense.

3\. Observe that the verb parōmeans not only _to prepare_ but also _to prepare for_, and governs the accusative case.

##### LESSON X

###### SECOND DECLENSION (_Continued_)

79\. We have been freely using feminine adjectives, like bona, in agreement with feminine nouns of the first declension and declined like them. _Masculine_ adjectives of this class are declined like dominus, and _neuters_ like pīlum. The adjective and noun, masculine and neuter, are therefore declined as follows:

Masculine Noun and Adjective

Neuter Noun and Adjective
- dominus bonus, _the good master_
- pīlum bonum, _the good spear_

In these sentences ancilla, ancillae, and ancillamdenote the class of persons to which _Lesbia_ belongs and explain who she is. Nouns so related that the second is only another name for the first and explains it are said to be in apposition, and are always in the same case.

_b._ Decline grātus, -a, -um; malus, -a, -um; altus, -a, -um; parvus, -a, -um.

84\. Thus far the adjectives have had the same terminations as the nouns. However, the agreement between the adjective and its noun does _not_ mean that they must have the same termination. If the adjective and the noun belong to different declensions, the terminations will, in many cases, not be the same. For example, nauta, _sailor_, is masculine and belongs to the first declension. The masculine form of the adjective bonusis of the second declension. Consequently, _a good sailor_ is nauta bonus. So, _the wicked farmer_ is agricola malus. Learn the following declensions:

1\. Dative with fīnitimus. (See [§ 43](#sec43).)

##### LESSON XIII

###### SECOND DECLENSION (_Continued_)

Declension of Nouns in _\-er_ and _\-ir_.In early Latin all the masculine nouns of the second declension ended in \-os. This \-oslater became \-usin words like servus, and was dropped entirely in words with bases ending in \-r, like puer, _boy_; ager, _field_; and vir, _man_. These words are therefore declined as follows:

puer , m., _boy_ ager, m., _field_ vir, m., _man_

Base puer-

Base agr-

Base vir-

Singular

40 _a._ The vocative case of these words is like the nominative, following the general rule ([§ 74. _a_](#sec74)).

_b._ The declension differs from that of servusonly in the nominative and vocative singular.

_c._ Note that in puerthe eremains all the way through, while in agerit is present only in the nominative. In puerthe ebelongs to the base, but in ager(base agr-) it does not, and was inserted in the nominative to make it easier to pronounce. Most words in \-erare declined like ager. _The genitive shows whether you are to follow_ puer_or_ ager.

93\. Masculine adjectives in \-erof the second declension are declined like nouns in \-er. A few of them are declined like puer, but most of them like ager. The feminine and neuter nominatives show which form to follow, thus,

Masc.

Fem.

4\. est, before its subject, _there is_; so sunt, _there are._

5\. Quae, _what kind of_, an interrogative adjective pronoun.

6\. What are the three possible translations of the present tense?

##### LESSON XIV

###### THE POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS

97\. Observe the sentences

_This is my shield_

_This shield is mine_

In the first sentence _my_ is a possessive adjective; in the second _mine_ is a possessive pronoun, for it takes the place of a noun, _this shield is mine_ being equivalent to _this shield is my shield_. Similarly, in Latin the possessives are sometimes _adjectives_ and sometimes _pronouns_.

98\. The possessives _my, mine, your, yours_, etc. are declined like adjectives of the first and second declensions.

Singular

_1st Pers._
- meus, mea, meum

_my, mine_

_2d Pers._
- tuus, tua, tuum

_your, yours_

_3d Pers._
- suus, sua, suum

_his (own), her (own), its (own)_

Plural

_1st Pers._
- noster, nostra, nostrum

_our, ours_

_2d Pers._
- vester, vestra, vestrum

_your, yours_

_3d Pers._
- suus, sua, suum

_their (own), theirs_

Note. Meushas the irregular vocative singular masculine mī, as mī fīlī, _O my son_.

_a._ The possessives agree with the name of the _thing possessed_ in gender, number, and case. Compare the English and Latin in

_Sextus is calling hisboy_

_Julia is calling herboy_
- Sextus

Iūlia

suum puerum vocat

Observe that suumagrees with puerum, and is unaffected by the gender of Sextus or Julia.

_b._ When _your, yours_, refers to _one_ person, use tuus; when to _more than one_, vester; as,

_Lesbia, your wreaths are pretty  
Girls, your wreaths are pretty_
- Corōnae tuae, Lesbia, sunt pulchrae  
Corōnae vestrae, puellae, sunt pulchrae

43 _c._ Suusis a _reflexive_ possessive, that is, it usually stands in the predicate and regularly refers back to the _subject_. Thus, Vir suōs servōs vocatmeans _The man calls his (own) slaves._ Here _his_ (suōs) refers to _man_ (vir), and could not refer to any one else.

_d._ Possessives are used much less frequently than in English, being omitted whenever the meaning is clear without them. (Cf. [§ 22](#sec22). a.) This is especially true of suus, -a, -um, which, when inserted, is more or less emphatic, like our _his own, her own_, etc.

###### THE ABLATIVE DENOTING _WITH_

100\. Of the various relations denoted by the ablative case ([§ 50](#sec50)) there is none more important than that expressed in English by the preposition _with_. This little word is not so simple as it looks. It does not always convey the same meaning, nor is it always to be translated by cum. This will become clear from the following sentences:

_a._ Mark is feeble _with_ (_for_ or _because of_) want of food

_b._ Diana kills the beasts _with_ (or _by_) her arrows

_c._ Julia is _with_ Sextus

_d._ The men fight _with_ great steadiness

_a._ In sentence _a_, _with want_ (_of food_) gives the cause of Mark’s feebleness. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative without a preposition, and the construction is called the ablative of cause:
- Mārcus est īnfīrmus inopiā cibī

_b._ In sentence _b_, _with_ (or _by_) _her arrows_ tells by means of whatDiana kills the beasts. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative without a preposition, and the construction is called the ablative of means:
- Diāna sagittīs suīs ferās necat

_c._ In sentence _c_ we are told that Julia is not alone, but in company withSextus. This idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative with the preposition cum, and the construction is called the ablative of accompaniment:
- Iūlia est cum Sextō

_d._ In sentence _d_ we are told how the men fight. The idea is one of manner. This is expressed in Latin by the ablative with cum, unless there is a modifying adjective present, in which case cummay be omitted. This construction is called the ablative of manner:
- Virī (cum) cōnstantiā magnā pugnant

101. You are now able to form four important rules for the ablative denoting _with_:

45 102.Rule. Ablative of Cause._Cause is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers the question Because of what?_

103\. Rule. Ablative of Means._Means is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers the question By means of what? With what?_

N.B. Cummust never be used with the ablative expressing cause or means.

104\. Rule. Ablative of Accompaniment._Accompaniment is denoted by the ablative with cum. This answers the question With whom?_

105\. Rule. Ablative of Manner._The ablative with cumis used to denote the manner of an action. Cummay be omitted, if an adjective is used with the ablative. This answers the question How? In what manner?_

106\. What uses of the ablative do you discover in the following passage, and what question does each answer?

The soldiers marched to the fort with great speed and broke down the gate with blows of their muskets. The inhabitants, terrified by the din, attempted to cross the river with their wives and children, but the stream was swollen with (_or_ by) the rain. Because of this many were swept away by the waters and only a few, almost overcome with fatigue, with great difficulty succeeded in gaining the farther shore.

##### LESSON XVI

###### THE NINE IRREGULAR ADJECTIVES

108\. There are nine irregular adjectives of the first and second declensions which have a peculiar termination in the genitive and dative singular of all genders:

Masc.

Fem.

Neut.

_Gen._
- \-īus

\-īus

\-īus

_Dat._
- \-ī

\-ī

\-ī

Otherwise they are declined like bonus, -a, -um. Learn the list and the meaning of each:
- alius, alia, aliud, _other, another_ (of several)
- alter, altera, alterum, _the one, the other_ (of two)
- ūnus, -a, -um, _one, alone_; (in the plural) _only_
- ūllus, -a, -um, _any_
- nūllus, -a, -um, _none, no_
- sōlus, -a, -um, _alone_
- tōtus, -a, -um, _all, whole, entire_
- uter, utra, utrum, _which?_ (of two)
- neuter, neutra, neutrum, _neither_ (of two)

The Plural is Regular

47 _a._ Note the peculiar neuter singular ending in \-dof alius. The genitive alīusis rare. Instead of it use alterīus, the genitive of alter.

_b._ These peculiar case endings are found also in the declension of pronouns (see [§ 114](#sec114)). For this reason these adjectives are sometimes called the pronominal adjectives.

110\. Learn the following idioms:
- alter, -era, -erum... alter, -era, -erum, _the one ... the other_ (of two)
- alius, -a, -ud... alius, -a, -ud, _one ... another_ (of any number)
- aliī, -ae, -a... aliī, -ae, -a, _some ... others_

###### EXAMPLES

1\. Alterum oppidum est magnum, alterum parvum, _the one town is large, the other small_ (of two towns).

2\. Aliud oppidum est validum, aliud īnfīrmum, _one town is strong, another weak_ (of towns in general).

3\. Aliī gladiōs, aliī scūta portant, _some carry swords, others shields._

111\. EXERCISES

#### I. 1. In utrā casā est Iūlia? Iūlia est in neutrā casā. 2. Nūllī malō puerō praemium dat magister. 3. Alter puer est nauta, alter agricola. 4. Aliī virī aquam, aliī terram amant. 5. Galba ūnus (_or_ sōlus) cum studiō labōrat. 6. Estne ūllus carrus in agrō meō? 7. Lesbia est ancilla alterīus dominī, Tullia alterīus. 8. Lesbia sōla cēnam parat. 9. Cēna nūllīus alterīus ancillae est bona. 10. Lesbia nūllī aliī virō cēnam dat.

Note. The pronominal adjectives, as you observe, regularly stand before and not after their nouns.

#### II. 1. The men of all Germany are preparing for war. 2. Some towns are great and others are small. 3. One boy likes chickens, another horses. 4. Already the booty of one town is in our fort. 5. Our whole village is suffering for (i.e. _weak because of_) lack of food. 6. The people are already hastening to the other town. 7. Among the Romans (there) is no lack of grain.

##### LESSON XVII

###### THE DEMONSTRATIVE _IS, EA, ID_

112\. A demonstrative is a word that points out an object definitely, as _this, that, these, those_. Sometimes these words are pronouns, as, _Do you hear these?_ and sometimes adjectives, as, _Do you hear these men?_ In the former case they are called demonstrative pronouns, in the latter demonstrative adjectives.

113\. Demonstratives are similarly used in Latin both as _pronouns_ and as _adjectives_. The one used most is

is\., masculine; ea, feminine; id, neuter

Singular

_this  
that_

Plural

_these  
those_

Is is declined as follows. Compare its declension with that of alius, [§ 109](#sec109).

Note that the base e-changes to i-in a few cases. The genitive singular eiusis pronounced _eh´yus_. In the plural the forms with two i’s are preferred and the two i’s are pronounced as one. Hence, pronounce iīas īand iīsas īs.

115\. Besides being used as demonstrative pronouns and adjectives the Latin demonstratives are regularly used for the personal pronoun _he, she, it_. As a personal pronoun, then, iswould have the following meanings:

Sing.

49 _Nom._

is\., _he_; ea, _she_; id, _it_

_Gen._

eius\., _of him_ or _his_; eius, _of her, her_, or _hers_; eius, _of it_ or _its_

_Dat._

_Acc._

eum\., _him_; eam, _her_; id, _it_

_Abl._
- eō, _with, from_, etc., _him_; eā, _with, from_, etc., _her_; eō, _with, from_, etc., _it_

Plur.

_Nom._

_Acc._
- eōs, eās, ea, _them_

_Abl._
- eīsor iīs, eīsor iīs, eīsor iīs, _with, from_, etc., _them_

Comparison between _suus_ and _is_.We learned above ([§ 98. _c_](#sec98)) that suusis a _reflexive_ possessive. When _his, her_ (poss.), _its, their_, do not refer to the subject of the sentence, we express _his, her, its_ by eius, the genitive singular of is, ea, id; and _their_ by the genitive plural, using eōrumto refer to a masculine or neuter antecedent noun and eārumto refer to a feminine one.

###### EXAMPLES

_Galba calls his_ (own) _son_, Galba suum fīlium vocat

_Galba calls his son_ (not his own, but another’s), Galba eius fīlium vocat

_Julia calls her_ (own) _children_, Iūlia suōs līberōs vocat

_Julia calls her children_ (not her own, but another’s), Iūlia eius līberōs vocat

_The men praise their_ (own) _boys_, virī suōs puerōs laudant

_The men praise their boys_ (not their own, but others’), virī eōrum puerōs laudant

1\. There are a number of departures from the normal order in this dialogue. Find them, and give the reason.

2\. When a noun is modified by both a genitive and an adjective, a favorite order of words is _adjective, genitive, noun_.

3\. A modifying genitive often stands between a preposition and its object.

##### LESSON XVIII

###### CONJUGATION

###### THE PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE TENSES OF SUM

119. The inflection of a verb is called its _conjugation_ (cf. [§ 23](#sec23)). In English the verb has but few changes in form, the different meanings being expressed by the use of personal pronouns and auxiliaries, as, _I am carried, we have carried, they shall have carried_, etc. In Latin, on the other hand, instead of using personal pronouns and auxiliary verbs, the form changes with the meaning. In this way the Romans expressed differences in _tense, mood, voice, person_, and _number_.

The Tenses.The different forms of a verb referring to different times are called its _tenses_. The chief distinctions of time are present, past, and future:

1\. The present, that is, _what is happening now_, or _what usually happens_, is expressed by

the Present Tense

2\. The past, that is, _what was happening, used to happen, happened, has happened_, or _had happened_, is expressed by

the Imperfect, Perfect, and Pluperfect Tenses

3\. The future, that is, _what is going to happen_, is expressed by

the Future and Future Perfect Tenses

The Moods.Verbs have inflection of _mood_ to indicate the manner in which they express action. The moods of the Latin verb are the _indicative, subjunctive, imperative_, and _infinitive_.

_a._ A verb is in the _indicative_ mood when it makes a statement or asks a question about something assumed as a fact. All the verbs we have used thus far are in the present indicative.

The Persons.There are three persons, as in English. The first person is the person speaking (_I sing_); the second person the person spoken to (_you sing_); the third person the person spoken of 52 (_he sings_). Instead of using personal pronouns for the different persons in the two numbers, singular and plural, the Latin verb uses the personal endings (cf. [§ 22 _a_](#sec22); [29](#sec29)). We have already learned that \-tis the ending of the third person singular in the active voice and \-ntof the third person plural. The complete list of personal endings of the active voice is as follows:

Singular

Plural

_1st Pers._

_I_
- \-mor \-ō

_we_
- \-mus

_2d Pers._

_thou_ or _you_
- \-s

_you_
- \-tis

_3d Pers._

_he, she, it_
- \-t

_they_
- \-nt

123. Most verbs form their moods and tenses after a regular plan and are called _regular_ verbs. Verbs that depart from this plan are called _irregular_. The verb _to be_ is irregular in Latin as in English. The present, imperfect, and future tenses of the indicative are inflected as follows:

Present Indicative

---

#### SINGULAR

---

#### PLURAL

_1st Pers._

su- m, _I am_

su- mus, _we are_

_2d Pers._

e- s, _you1 are_

es- tis, _you1 are_

_3d Pers._

es- t, _he, she_, or _it is_

su- nt, _they are_

Imperfect Indicative

_1st Pers._

er-a- m, _I was_

er-ā´-mus, _we were_

_2d Pers._

er-ā- s, _you were_

er-ā´-tis, _you were_

_3d Pers._

er-a- t, _he, she_, or _it was_

er-ā- nt, _they were_

Future Indicative

_1st Pers._

er- ō, _I shall be_

er´-i-mus, _we shall be_

_2d Pers._

er-i- s, _you will be_

er´-i-tis, _you will be_

_3d Pers._

er-i- t, _he will be_

er-u- nt, _they will be_

_a._ Be careful about vowel quantity and accent in these forms, and consult [§§ 12.2](#sec12); [14](#sec14); [15](#sec15).

1\. Observe that in English _you are_, _you were_, etc. may be either singular or plural. In Latin the singular and plural forms are never the same.

###### THE FOUR REGULAR CONJUGATIONS · PRESENT ACTIVE INDICATIVE OF _AMŌ_ AND _MONEŌ_

126\. There are four conjugations of the regular verbs. These conjugations are distinguished from each other by the final vowel of the present conjugation-stem.1 This vowel is called the _distinguishing vowel_, and is best seen in the present infinitive.

1\. The _stem_ is the body of a word to which the terminations are attached. It is often identical with the base (cf. [§ 58](#sec58)). If, however, the stem ends in a vowel, the latter does not appear in the base, but is variously combined with the inflectional terminations. This point is further explained in [§ 230](#sec230).

Below is given the _present infinitive_ of a verb of each conjugation, the _present stem_, and the _distinguishing vowel._

55 1\. The present tense is inflected by adding the personal endings to the present stem, and its first person uses \-oand not \-m. The form amōis for amā-ō, the two vowels ā-ōcontracting to ō. In moneōthere is no contraction. _Nearly all regular verbs ending in \-eobelong to the second conjugation._

2\. Note that the long final vowel of the stem is shortened before another vowel (monē-ō= mo´nĕō), and before final \-t(amăt, monĕt) and \-nt(amănt, monĕnt). Compare [§ 12. 2](#sec12).

The Translation of the Present.In English there are three ways of expressing present action. We may say, for example, _I live, I am living_, or _I do live_. In Latin the one expression habitōcovers all three of these expressions.

We plow, we are plowing, we do plow. 2. They care for, they are caring for, they do care for. 3. You give, you are having, you do have (_sing_.). 4. We destroy, I do long for, they are living. 5. He calls, they see, we are telling. 6. We do fight, we order, he is moving, he prepares. 7. They are laboring, we kill, you announce.

##### LESSON XX

###### IMPERFECT ACTIVE INDICATIVE OF _AMŌ_ AND _MONEŌ_

Tense Signs.Instead of using auxiliary verbs to express differences in tense, like _was_, _shall_, _will_, etc., Latin adds to the verb stem certain elements that have the force of auxiliary verbs. These are called _tense signs_.

Formation and Inflection of the Imperfect.The tense sign of the imperfect is \-bā-, which is added to the present stem. The imperfect consists, therefore, of three parts:

Meaning of the Imperfect.The Latin imperfect describes an act as _going on_ or _progressing in past time_, like the English past-progressive tense (as, _I was walking_). It is the regular tense used to describe a past situation or condition of affairs.

Apollō et Diāna erant līberī Lātōnae. Iīs Thēbānī sacra crēbra parābant.1 Oppidānī amābant Lātōnam et līberōs eius. Id superbae rēgīnae erat molestum. “Cūr,” inquit, “Lātōnae et līberīs sacra parātis? Duōs līberōs habet Lātōna; quattuordecim habeō ego. Ubi sunt mea sacra?” Lātōna iīs verbīs2 īrāta līberōs suōs vocat. Ad eam volant Apollō Diānaque et sagittīs3 suīs miserōs līberōs rēgīnae superbae dēlent. Niobē, nūper laeta, nunc misera, sedet apud līberōs interfectōs et cum perpetuīs lacrimīs4 eōs dēsīderat.

Note. Consult the general vocabulary for Apollō, inquit, duōs, and quattuordecim. Try to remember the meaning of all the other words.

1\. Observe the force of the imperfect here, _used to prepare_, _were in the habit of preparing_; so amābantdenotes a past situation of affairs. (See [§ 134](#sec134).)

2\. Ablative of cause.

3\. Ablative of means.

4\. This may be either manner or accompaniment. It is often impossible to draw a sharp line between means, manner, and accompaniment. The Romans themselves drew no sharp distinction. It was enough for them if the general idea demanded the ablative case.

##### LESSON XXII

###### REVIEW OF VERBS · THE DATIVE WITH ADJECTIVES

141\. Review the present, imperfect, and future active indicative, both orally and in writing, of sumand the verbs in [§ 129](#sec129).

142\. We learned in [§ 43](#sec43) for what sort of expressions we may expect the dative, and in [§ 44](#sec44) that one of its commonest uses is with _verbs_ to express the indirect object. It is also very common with _adjectives_ to express the object toward which the quality denoted by the adjective is directed. We have already had a number of cases 60 where grātus, _agreeable to_, was so followed by a dative; and in the last lesson we had molestus, _annoying to_, followed by that case. The usage may be more explicitly stated by the following rule:

143\. Rule. Dative with Adjectives._The dative is used with adjectives to denote the object toward which the given quality is directed. Such are, especially, those meaning near, also fit, friendly, pleasing, like, and their opposites._

144\. Among such adjectives memorize the following:
- idōneus, -a, -um, _fit, suitable_ (for)
- amīcus, -a, -um, _friendly_ (to)
- inimicus, -a, -um, _hostile_ (to)
- grātus, -a, -um, _pleasing_ (to), _agreeable_ (to)
- molestus, -a, -um, _annoying_ (to), _troublesome_ (to)
- fīnitimus, -a, -um, _neighboring_ (to)
- proximus, -a, -um, _nearest, next_ (to)

##### LESSON XXIII

###### PRESENT ACTIVE INDICATIVE OF _REGŌ_ AND _AUDIŌ_

147\. As we learned in [§ 126](#sec126), the present stem of the third conjugation ends in \-ĕ, and of the fourth in \-ī. The inflection of the Present Indicative is as follows:

Conjugation III

Conjugation IV
- re´gō, re´gere(_rule_)
- au´dio, audī´re(_hear_)

Pres. Stem regĕ-

Pres. Stem audī-

---

#### SINGULAR

1\. re´gō, _I rule_

au´diō, _I hear_

2\. re´gis, _you rule_

au´dīs, _you hear_

3\. re´git, _he (she, it) rules_

au´dit, _he (she, it) hears_

1\. re´gimus, _we rule_

audī´mus, _we hear_

2\. re´gitis, _you rule_

audī´tis, _you hear_

3\. re´gunt, _they rule_

au´diunt, _they hear_

1\. The personal endings are the same as before.

2\. The final short \-e-of the stem regĕ-combines with the \-ōin the first person, becomes \-u-in the third person plural, and becomes \-ĭ-elsewhere. The inflection is like that of erō, the future of sum.

62 3\. In audiōthe personal endings are added regularly to the stem audī-. In the third person plural \-u-is inserted between the stem and the personal ending, as audi-u-nt. Note that the long vowel of the stem is shortened before final \-tjust as in amōand moneō. (Cf. [§ 12. 2](#sec12).)

Note that \-i-is always short in the third conjugation and long in the fourth, excepting where long vowels are regularly shortened. (Cf. [§ 12. 1, 2](#sec12).)

148\. Like regōand audiōinflect the present active indicative of the following verbs:

Indicative Present

Infinitive Present
- agō, _I drive_

The Dative with Special Intransitive Verbs.We learned above ([§ 20. _a_](#sec20)) that a verb which does not admit of a direct object is called an _intransitive_ verb. Many such verbs, however, are of such meaning that they can govern an indirect object, which will, of course, be in the dative case ([§ 45](#sec45)). Learn the following list of intransitive verbs with their meanings. In each case the dative indirect object is the person or thing to which a benefit, injury, or feeling is directed. (Cf. [§ 43](#sec43).)
- crēdō, crēdere, _believe_ (give belief to)
- faveō, favēre, _favor_ (show favor to)
- noceō, nocēre, _injure_ (do harm to)
- pāreō, pārēre, _obey_ (give obedience to)
- persuādeō, persuādēre, _persuade_ (offer persuasion to)
- resistō, resistere, _resist_ (offer resistance to)
- studeō, studēre, _be eager for_ (give attention to)

65 154.Rule. Dative with Intransitive Verbs._The dative of the indirect object is used with the intransitive verbs crēdō, faveō, noceō, pāreō, persuādeō, resistō, studeō, and others of like meaning._

Multī verbīs eōrum nōn crēdunt. 2. Meī fīnitimī cōnsiliō tuō nōn favēbunt, quod bellō student. 3. Tiberius et Gāius disciplīnae dūrae nōn resistēbant et Cornēliae pārēbant. 4. Dea erat inimīca septem fīliābus rēgīnae. 5. Dūra poena et perpetua trīstitia rēgīnae nōn persuādēbunt. 6. Nūper ea resistēbat et nunc resistit potentiae Lātōnae. 7. Mox sagittae volābunt et līberīs miserīs nocēbunt.

##### LESSON XXV

###### FUTURE ACTIVE INDICATIVE OF _REGŌ_ AND _AUDIŌ_

156\. In the future tense of the third and fourth conjugations we meet with a new tense sign. Instead of using \-bi-, as in the first and second conjugations, we use \-ā-1 in the first person singular and \-ē-in the rest of the tense. In the third conjugation the final \-ĕ-of the stem is dropped before this tense sign; in the fourth conjugation the final \-ī-of the stem is retained.2

1\. The \-ā-is shortened before \-mfinal, and \-ē-before \-tfinal and before \-nt. (Cf. [§ 12. 2](#sec12).)

2\. The \-ī-is, of course, shortened, being before another vowel. (Cf. [§ 12. 1](#sec12).)

###### VERBS IN _\-IŌ_ OF THE THIRD CONJUGATION · THE IMPERATIVE MOOD

159\. There are a few common verbs ending in \-iōwhich do not belong to the fourth conjugation, as you might infer, but to the third. The fact that they belong to the third conjugation is shown by the ending of the infinitive. (Cf. [§ 126](#sec126).) Compare
- audiō, audī´re(_hear_), fourth conjugation
- capiō, ca´pere(_take_), third conjugation

67 160.The present, imperfect, and future active indicative of capiōare inflected as follows:
- capiō, capere, _take_

1\. Observe that capiōand the other \-iōverbs follow the fourth conjugation wherever in the fourth conjugation _two vowels occur in succession._ (Cf. capiō, audiō; capiunt, audiunt; and all the imperfect and future.) All other forms are like the third conjugation. (Cf. capis, regis; capit, regit; etc.)

2\. Like capiō, inflect
- faciō, facere, _make, do_
- fugiō, fugere, _flee_
- iaciō, iacere, _hurl_
- rapiō, rapere, _seize_

The Imperative Mood.The imperative mood expresses a command; as, _come!_ _send!_ The present tense of the imperative is used only in the second person, singular and plural. _The singular in the active voice is regularly the same in form as the present stem. The plural is formed by adding \-teto the singular._

##### LESSON XXVII

###### THE PASSIVE VOICE · PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE INDICATIVE OF _AMŌ_ AND _MONEŌ_

The Voices.Thus far the verb forms have been in the _active voice_; that is, they have represented the subject as _performing_ an action; as,

The lion——> _killed_——> the hunter

A verb is said to be in the _passive voice_ when it represents its subject as _receiving_ an action; as,

The lion <—— _was killed_ <—— by the hunter

Note the direction of the arrows.

69 164.

Passive Personal Endings.In the passive voice we use a different set of personal endings. They are as follows:

Sing.

1\. \-r, _I_

Plur.

1\. \-mur, _we_

2\. \-ris, \-re, _you_

2\. \-minī, _you_

3\. \-tur, _he, she, it_

#### PERSEUS ANDROMEDAM SERVAT

168\. Per´seus and Androm´eda

First learn the [special vocabulary](LatinBegin2.html#sec168vocab), p. 288.

Perseus fīlius erat Iovis,2 maximī3 deōrum. Dē eō multās fabulās nārrant poētae. Eī favent deī, eī magica arma et ālās dant. Eīs tēlīs armātus et ālīs frētus ad multās terrās volābat et mōnstra saeva dēlēbat et miserīs īnfīrmīsque auxilium dabat. 72 Aethiopia est terra Āfricae. Eam terram Cēpheus5 regēbat. Eī6 Neptūnus, maximus aquārum deus, erat īrātus et mittit7 mōnstrum saevum ad Aethiopiam. Ibi mōnstrum nōn sōlum lātīs pulchrīsque Aethiopiae agrīs nocēbat sed etiam domicilia agricolārum dēlēbat, et multōs virōs, fēminās, līberōsque necābat. Populus ex agrīs fugiēbat et oppida mūrīs validīs mūniēbat. Tum Cēpheus magnā trīstitiā commōtus ad Iovis ōrāculum properat et ita dīcit: “Amīcī meī necantur; agrī meī vāstantur. Audī verba mea, Iuppiter. Dā miserīs auxilium. Age mōnstrum saevum ex patriā.”

2\. Iovis, the genitive of Iuppiter.

3\. Used substantively, _the greatest_. So below, l. 4, miserīsand īnfīrmīsare used substantively.

4\. Pronounce in two syllables, _Ce´pheus_.

5\. Eī, _at him_, dative with īrātus.

6\. The present is often used, as in English, in speaking of a past action, in order to make the story more vivid and exciting.

##### LESSON XXVIII

###### PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE INDICATIVE PASSIVE OF _REGŌ_ AND _AUDIŌ_

169\. Review the present, imperfect, and future indicative active of regōand audiō, and learn the passive of the same tenses ([§§ 490](LatinBegin2.html#sec490), [491](LatinBegin2.html#sec491)).

_a._ Observe that the tense signs of the imperfect and future are the same as in the active voice, and that the passive personal endings ([§ 164](#sec164)) are added instead of the active ones.

_b._ Note the slight irregularity in the second person singular present of the third conjugation. There the final \-e-of the stem is not changed to \-i-, as it is in the active. We therefore have re´gerisor re´gere, _not_ re´giris, re´gire.

_c._ Inflect agō, dīcō, dūcō, mūniō, reperiō, in the present, imperfect, and future indicative, active and passive.

Tum ōrāculum ita respondet: “Mala est fortūna tua. Neptūnus, magnus aquārum deus, terrae Aethiopiae inimīcus, eās poenās mittit. Sed parā īrātō deō sacrum idōneum et mōnstrum saevum ex patriā tuā agētur. Andromeda fīlia tua est mōnstrō grāta. Dā eam mōnstrō. Servā cāram patriam et vītam populī tuī.” Andromeda autem erat puella pulchra. Eam amābat Cēpheus maximē.

##### LESSON XXIX

###### PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE INDICATIVE PASSIVE OF _\-IŌ_ VERBS · PRESENT PASSIVE INFINITIVE AND IMPERATIVE

172\. Review the active voice of capiō, present, imperfect, and future, and learn the passive of the same tenses ([§ 492](LatinBegin2.html#sec492)).

_a._ The present forms capiorand capiunturare like audior, audiuntur, and the rest of the tense is like regor.

_b._ In like manner inflect the passive of iaciōand rapiō.

The Infinitive.The infinitive mood gives the general meaning of the verb without person or number; as, amāre, _to love_. Infinitive means _unlimited_. The forms of the other moods, being limited by person and number, are called the _finite_, or limited, verb forms.

74 174.The forms of the Present Infinitive, active and passive, are as follows:
