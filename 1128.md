### King Lear's Palace.

> Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. \[Kent and Glouceste converse

Edmund stands back.\]  

Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany  
than Cornwall 

Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of  
thekingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,  
forequalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can makechoice of either's moiety

Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?  

Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so  
oftenblush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't

Kent. I cannot conceive you

Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grewround-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere  
shehad a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?  
Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being soproper

Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder  
thanthis, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave  
camesomething saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet  
washis mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and thewhoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble  
gentleman,Edmund?  
Edm. \[comes forward\] No, my lord

Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourablefriend

Edm. My services to your lordship

Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better

Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving

Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. Sound a sennet. The King is coming

> Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with                         

Followers Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester

Glou. I shall, my liege.                            

> Exeunt \[Gloucester and Edmund\]

Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.Give me the map there. Know we have dividedIn three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intentTo shake all cares and business from our age,Conferring them on younger strengths while weUnburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,And you, our no less loving son of Albany,We have this hour a constant will to publishOur daughters' several dowers, that future strifeMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters(Since now we will divest us both of rule,Interest of territory, cares of state),Which of you shall we say doth love us most?That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest-born, speak first

Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.Beyond all manner of so much I love you

Cor. \[aside\] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent

Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issueBe this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak

Reg. Sir, I am madeOf the selfsame metal that my sister is,And prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love;Only she comes too short, that I professMyself an enemy to all other joysWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear Highness' love

Cor. \[aside\] Then poor Cordelia!And yet not so; since I am sure my love'sMore richer than my tongue

Lear. To thee and thine hereditary everRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,No less in space, validity, and pleasureThan that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,Although the last, not least; to whose young loveThe vines of France and milk of BurgundyStrive to be interest; what can you say to drawA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak

Cor. Nothing, my lord

Lear. Nothing?  
Cor. Nothing

Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again

Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth. I love your MajestyAccording to my bond; no more nor less

Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,Lest it may mar your fortunes

Cor. Good my lord,You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; IReturn those duties back as are right fit,Obey you, love you, and most honour you.Why have my sisters husbands, if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carryHalf my love with him, half my care and duty.Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,To love my father all

Lear. But goes thy heart with this?  
Cor. Ay, good my lord

Lear. So young, and so untender?  
Cor. So young, my lord, and true

Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,The mysteries of Hecate and the night;By all the operation of the orbsFrom whom we do exist and cease to be;Here I disclaim all my paternal care,Propinquity and property of blood,And as a stranger to my heart and meHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,Or he that makes his generation messesTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosomBe as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,As thou my sometime daughter

Kent. Good my liege-  
Lear. Peace, Kent!Come not between the dragon and his wrath.I lov'd her most, and thought to set my restOn her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-So be my grave my peace as here I giveHer father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.I do invest you jointly in my power,Preeminence, and all the large effectsThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,With reservation of an hundred knights,By you to be sustain'd, shall our abodeMake with you by due turns. Only we still retainThe name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,Revenue, execution of the rest,Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,This coronet part betwixt you

Kent. Royal Lear,Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,As my great patron thought on in my prayers-  
Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft

Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invadeThe region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerlyWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speakWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's boundWhen majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;And in thy best consideration checkThis hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,Nor are those empty-hearted whose low soundReverbs no hollowness

Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!  
Kent. My life I never held but as a pawnTo wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,Thy safety being the motive

Lear. Out of my sight!  
Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remainThe true blank of thine eye

Lear. Now by Apollo-  
Kent. Now by Apollo, King,Thou swear'st thy gods in vain

Lear. O vassal! miscreant!                              \[Lays his hand on his sword.\]  
Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!  
Kent. Do!Kill thy physician, and the fee bestowUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,I'll tell thee thou dost evil

Lear. Hear me, recreant!On thine allegiance, hear me!Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd prideTo come between our sentence and our power,-Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world,And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,This shall not be revok'd

Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\[To Cordelia\] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,  
maid,That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!\[To Regan and Goneril\] And your large speeches may your  
deeds   approve,That good effects may spring from words of love.Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;He'll shape his old course in a country new

> 
> Exit

> Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;  

Attendants

Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord

Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,We first address toward you, who with this kingHath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the leastWill you require in present dower with her,Or cease your quest of love?  
Bur. Most royal Majesty,I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,Nor will you tender less

Lear. Right noble Burgundy,When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.If aught within that little seeming substance,Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,She's there, and she is yours

Bur. I know no answer

Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,Take her, or leave her?  
Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.Election makes not up on such conditions

Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,I tell you all her wealth. \[To France\] For you, great King,I would not from your love make such a strayTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech youT' avert your liking a more worthier wayThan on a wretch whom nature is asham'dAlmost t' acknowledge hers

France. This is most strange,That she that even but now was your best object,The argument of your praise, balm of your age,Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of timeCommit a thing so monstrous to dismantleSo many folds of favour. Sure her offenceMust be of such unnatural degreeThat monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affectionFall'n into taint; which to believe of herMust be a faith that reason without miracleShould never plant in me

Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,If for I want that glib and oily artTo speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,I'll do't before I speak- that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,No unchaste action or dishonoured step,That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;But even for want of that for which I am richer-A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongueAs I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking

Lear. Better thouHadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better

France. Is it but this- a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love's not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standsAloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry

Bur. Royal Lear,Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy

Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm

Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a fatherThat you must lose a husband

Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!Since that respects of fortune are his love,I shall not be his wife

France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglectMy love should kindle to inflam'd respect.Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.Not all the dukes in wat'rish BurgundyCan buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.Thou losest here, a better where to find

Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. Therefore be goneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.Come, noble Burgundy.        

> Flourish. 

> Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, \[Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester, and Attendants\]

France. Bid farewell to your sisters

Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyesCordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;And, like a sister, am most loath to callYour faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.To your professed bosoms I commit him;But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,I would prefer him to a better place!So farewell to you both

Gon. Prescribe not us our duties

Reg. Let your studyBe to content your lord, who hath receiv'd youAt fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,And well are worth the want that you have wanted

Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.Well may you prosper!  
France. Come, my fair Cordelia.                                

> Exeunt France and Cordelia

Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearlyappertains to us both. I think our father will hence  
to-night

Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us

Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation wehave made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd oursister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast  
heroff appears too grossly

Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but  
slenderlyknown himself

Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; thenmust we look to receive from his age, not alone theimperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithalthe unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring  
withthem

Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as  
thisof Kent's banishment

Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France  
andhim. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry  
authoritywith such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of  
hiswill but offend us

Reg. We shall further think on't

Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.

#### Scene II. 

### The Earl of Gloucester's Castle

> Enter \[Edmund the\] Bastard solus, \[with a letter\]

Edm. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy lawMy services are bound. Wherefore should IStand in the plague of custom, and permitThe curiosity of nations to deprive me,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshinesLag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?When my dimensions are as well compact,My mind as generous, and my shape as true,As honest madam's issue? Why brand they usWith base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, takeMore composition and fierce qualityThan doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fopsGot 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.Our father's love is to the bastard EdmundAs to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,And my invention thrive, Edmund the baseShall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.Now, gods, stand up for bastards!  

> Enter Gloucester

Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?Confin'd to exhibition? All this doneUpon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?  
Edm. So please your lordship, none.                                      \[Puts up the letter.\]  
Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?  
Edm. I know no news, my lord

Glou. What paper were you reading?  
Edm. Nothing, my lord

Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into  
yourpocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hideitself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not needspectacles

Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my  
brotherthat I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I haveperus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking

Glou. Give me the letter, sir.

Edm. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents,  
asin part I understand them, are to blame

Glou. Let's see, let's see!  

Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.

Glou. (reads 'This policy and reverence of age makes the worldbitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from ustill our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idleand fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who  ) 
sways,not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till Iwak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and  
livethe beloved of your brother, 'EDGAR.'  

Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it? Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. Glou. You know the character to be your brother's? Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. Glou. It is his. Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents. Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business? Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he? Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger. Glou. Think you so? Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening. Glou. He cannot be such a monster. Edm. Nor is not, sure. Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution. Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal. Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange. 

> Exit. Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar-
> Enter Edgar

   and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy

Mycue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o'  
Bedlam.O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la,  
mi

Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are  
youin?  
Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other  
day,what should follow these eclipses

Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?  
Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:  
asof unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needlessdiffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,nuptial breaches, and I know not what

Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?  
Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last?  
Edg. The night gone by

Edm. Spake you with him?  
Edg. Ay, two hours together

Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him  
byword or countenance  
Edg. None at all

Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at  
myentreaty forbear his presence until some little time hathqualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant  
sorageth in him that with the mischief of your person it wouldscarcely allay

Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong

Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance  
tillthe speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire  
with meto my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear mylord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir  
abroad,go arm'd

Edg. Arm'd, brother?  
Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no  
honest manif there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you  
what Ihave seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image andhorror of it. Pray you, away!  
Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?  
Edm. I do serve you in this business.                                                

> Exit Edgar.A credulous father! and a brother noble,Whose nature is so far from doing harmsThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honestyMy practices ride easy! I see the business.Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;All with me's meet that I can fashion fit

Gon. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?  
Osw. Ay, madam

Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hourHe flashes into one gross crime or otherThat sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids usOn every trifle. When he returns from hunting,I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.If you come slack of former services,You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.                                            \[Horns within.\]  
Osw. He's coming, madam; I hear him

Gon. Put on what weary negligence you please,You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.If he distaste it, let him to our sister,Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,That still would manage those authoritiesThat he hath given away! Now, by my life,Old fools are babes again, and must be us'dWith checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.Remember what I have said

Osw. Very well, madam

Gon. And let his knights have colder looks among you.What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,That I may speak.

Kent. If but as well I other accents borrow,That can my speech defuse, my good intentMay carry through itself to that full issueFor which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,Shall find thee full of labours

Lear. Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. \[

> Exitan Attendant.\] How now? What art thou?  

Kent. A man, sir

Lear. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?  
Kent. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him  
trulythat will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, toconverse with him that is wise and says little, to fearjudgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish

Lear. What art thou?  
Kent. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King

Lear. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king,  
thouart poor enough. What wouldst thou?  
Kent. Service

Lear. Who wouldst thou serve?  
Kent. You

Lear. Dost thou know me, fellow?  
Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I  
wouldfain call master

Lear. What's that?  
Kent. Authority

Lear. What services canst thou do?  
Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale  
intelling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That whichordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of  
meis diligence

Lear. How old art thou?  
Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so  
old todote on her for anything. I have years on my back  
forty-eight

Lear. Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse

\[Enter Knight\]

   How now? Where's that mongrel?  
Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well

Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?  
Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would  
not

Lear. He would not?  
Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my  
judgmentyour Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious  
affectionas you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness  
appearsas well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself  
alsoand your daughter

Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?  
Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; formy duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd

Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I haveperceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have ratherblamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretenceand purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. Butwhere's my fool? I have not seen him this two days

Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the foolhath much pined away

Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell mydaughter I would speak with her. \[

Osw. My lady's father

Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog!  
youslave! you cur!  
Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon

Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?                                             \[Strikes him.\]  
Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord

Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?                                       \[Trips up his heels

Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love  
thee

Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;

Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of  
thyservice. \[Gives money.\]  

> Enter Fool

Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.                                     \[Offers Kent his cap.\]  
Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?  
Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb

Kent. Why, fool?  
Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an  
thoucanst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold  
shortly.There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two  
on'sdaughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. Ifthou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!  
Lear. Why, my boy?  
Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs  
myself.There's mine! beg another of thy daughters

Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip

Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,  
whenLady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink

Lear. A pestilent gall to me!  
Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech

Lear. Do

Fool. Mark it, nuncle.     Have more than thou showest,     Speak less than thou knowest,     Lend less than thou owest,     Ride more than thou goest,     Learn more than thou trowest,     Set less than thou throwest;     Leave thy drink and thy whore,     And keep in-a-door,     And thou shalt have more     Than two tens to a score

Kent. This is nothing, fool

Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave  
menothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?  
Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing

Fool. \[to Kent\] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his landcomes to. He will not believe a fool

Lear. A bitter fool!  
Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitterfool and a sweet fool?  
Lear. No, lad; teach me

Fool. That lord that counsell'd thee       To give away thy land,     Come place him here by me-       Do thou for him stand.     The sweet and bitter fool       Will presently appear;     The one in motley here,       The other found out there

Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?  
Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wastborn with

Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord

Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had  
amonopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,  
theywill not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll besnatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee twocrowns

Lear. What two crowns shall they be?  
Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up  
themeat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown  
i'th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass  
onthy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald  
crownwhen thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself  
inthis, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so

   \[Sings\] Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,             For wise men are grown foppish;           They know not how their wits to wear,             Their manners are so apish

Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?  
Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy  
daughtersthy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st  
downthine own breeches,  

   \[Sings\] Then they for sudden joy did weep,             And I for sorrow sung,           That such a king should play bo-peep             And go the fools among

   Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool  
tolie. I would fain learn to lie

Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd

Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll  
have mewhipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for  
lying;and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had  
rather beany kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left  
nothingi' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings

> Enter Goneril

Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks  
youare too much o' late i' th' frown

Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care  
forher frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am  
betterthan thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.\[To Goneril\] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your  
facebids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!  

      He that keeps nor crust nor crum,       Weary of all, shall want some.-  

   \[Points at Lear\] That's a sheal'd peascod

Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,But other of your insolent retinueDo hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forthIn rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,I had thought, by making this well known unto you,To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,That you protect this course, and put it onBy your allowance; which if you should, the faultWould not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,Might in their working do you that offenceWhich else were shame, that then necessityMust call discreet proceeding

Fool. For you know, nuncle,  

    The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long     That it had it head bit off by it young

   So out went the candle, and we were left darkling

Lear. Are you our daughter?  
Gon. Come, sir,I would you would make use of that good wisdomWhereof I know you are fraught, and put awayThese dispositions that of late transform youFrom what you rightly are

Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?Whoop, Jug, I love thee!  
Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?Either his notion weakens, his discerningsAre lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!Who is it that can tell me who I am?  
Fool. Lear's shadow

Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuadedI had daughters

Fool. Which they will make an obedient father

Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?  
Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savourOf other your new pranks. I do beseech youTo understand my purposes aright.As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and boldThat this our court, infected with their manners,Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lustMake it more like a tavern or a brothelThan a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speakFor instant remedy. Be then desir'dBy her that else will take the thing she begsA little to disquantity your train,And the remainder that shall still dependTo be such men as may besort your age,Which know themselves, and you

Lear. Darkness and devils!Saddle my horses! Call my train together!Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;Yet have I left a daughter

Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabbleMake servants of their betters

> Enter Albany

Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,More hideous when thou show'st thee in a childThan the sea-monster!  
Alb. Pray, sir, be patient

Lear. \[to Goneril\] Detested kite, thou liest!My train are men of choice and rarest parts,That all particulars of duty knowAnd in the most exact regard supportThe worships of their name.- O most small fault,How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of natureFrom the fix'd place; drew from my heart all loveAnd added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!Beat at this gate that let thy folly in \[Strikes his head.\]And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people

Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorantOf what hath mov'd you

Lear. It may be so, my lord.Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intendTo make this creature fruitful.Into her womb convey sterility;Dry up in her the organs of increase;And from her derogate body never springA babe to honour her! If she must teem,Create her child of spleen, that it may liveAnd be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,Turn all her mother's pains and benefitsTo laughter and contempt, that she may feelHow sharper than a serpent's tooth it isTo have a thankless child! Away, away! 

> Exit

Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?  
Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;But let his disposition have that scopeThat dotage gives it

> Enter Lear

Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?Within a fortnight?  
Alb. What's the matter, sir?  
Lear. I'll tell thee. \[To Goneril\] Life and death! I am asham'dThat thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!Th' untented woundings of a father's cursePierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,And cast you, with the waters that you lose,To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.When she shall hear this of thee, with her nailsShe'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt findThat I'll resume the shape which thou dost thinkI have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.                       

> Exeunt \[Lear, Kent, and Attendants\]

Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?  
Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,To the great love I bear you -  
Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!\[To the Fool\] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your  
master!  
Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee

    A fox when one has caught her,     And such a daughter,     Should sure to the slaughter,     If my cap would buy a halter.     So the fool follows after. 

> Exit

Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?'Tis politic and safe to let him keepAt point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rsAnd hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!  
Alb. Well, you may fear too far

Gon. Safer than trust too far.Let me still take away the harms I fear,Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.If she sustain him and his hundred knights,When I have show'd th' unfitness-  

> Enter \[Oswald the\] Steward

   How now, Oswald?What, have you writ that letter to my sister?  
Osw. Yes, madam

Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!Inform her full of my particular fear,And thereto add such reasons of your ownAs may compact it more. Get you gone,And hasten your return. \[

> Exit Oswald.\] No, no, my lord!This milky gentleness and course of yours,Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,You are much more at task for want of wisdomThan prais'd for harmful mildness

Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.Striving to better, oft we mar what's well

Gon. Nay then-  
Alb. Well, well; th' event.

Fool. If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger

Lear. Ay, boy

Fool. Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go

Lear. Ha, ha, ha!  
Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for  
thoughshe's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tellwhat I can tell

Lear. What canst tell, boy?  
Fool. She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thoucanst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?  
Lear. No

Fool. Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what  
aman cannot smell out, 'a may spy into

Lear. I did her wrong

Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?  
Lear. No

Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house

Lear. Why?  
Fool. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his  
daughters,and leave his horns without a case

Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horsesready?  
Fool. Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven

#### Scene I. 

### A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester

> Enter \[Edmund the\] Bastard and Curan, meeting

Edm. Save thee, Curan

Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given himnotice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will  
behere with him this night

Edm. How comes that?  
Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean  
thewhisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?  
Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?  
Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two  
Dukesof Cornwall and Albany?  
Edm. Not a word

Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir. 

> Exit

Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!This weaves itself perforce into my business.My father hath set guard to take my brother;And I have one thing, of a queasy question,Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!  

> Enter Edgar

   My father watches. O sir, fly this place!Intelligence is given where you are hid.You have now the good advantage of the night.Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,And Regan with him. Have you nothing saidUpon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?Advise yourself

Edg. I am sure on't, not a word

Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.                                                

> Exit Edgar.Some blood drawn on me would beget opinionOf my more fierce endeavour. \[Stabs his arm.\] I have seen   drunkardsDo more than this in sport.- Father, father!-Stop, stop! No help?  
> Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches

Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?  
Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moonTo stand 's auspicious mistress

Glou. But where is he?  
Edm. Look, sir, I bleed

Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?  
Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-  
Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after. \[

> Exeunt some Servants\].By no means what?  

Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;But that I told him the revenging gods'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;Spoke with how manifold and strong a bondThe child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,Seeing how loathly opposite I stoodTo his unnatural purpose, in fell motionWith his prepared sword he charges homeMy unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,Or whether gasted by the noise I made,Full suddenly he fled

Glou. Let him fly far.Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.By his authority I will proclaim itThat he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;He that conceals him, death

Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intentAnd found him pight to do it, with curst speechI threaten'd to discover him. He replied,'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,If I would stand against thee, would the reposalOf any trust, virtue, or worth in theeMake thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny(As this I would; ay, though thou didst produceMy very character), I'ld turn it allTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;And thou must make a dullard of the world,If they not thought the profits of my deathWere very pregnant and potential spursTo make thee seek it.'  
Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!Would he deny his letter? I never got him.                                             Tucket within.Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his pictureI will send far and near, that all the kingdomMay have due note of him, and of my land,Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the meansTo make thee capable

> Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants

Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither(Which I can call but now I have heard strange news) 
Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too shortWhich can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?  
Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!  
Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?  
Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!  
Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knightsThat tend upon my father?  
Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!  
Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort

Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.I have this present evening from my sisterBeen well inform'd of them, and with such cautionsThat, if they come to sojourn at my house,I'll not be there

Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.Edmund, I hear that you have shown your fatherA childlike office

Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir

Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'dThis hurt you see, striving to apprehend him

Corn. Is he pursued?  
Glou. Ay, my good lord

Corn. If he be taken, he shall never moreBe fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,Whose virtue and obedience doth this instantSo much commend itself, you shall be ours.Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;You we first seize on

Edm. I shall serve you, sir,Truly, however else

Glou. For him I thank your Grace

Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-  
Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,Wherein we must have use of your advice.Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,Of differences, which I best thought it fitTo answer from our home. The several messengersFrom hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestowYour needful counsel to our business,Which craves the instant use

Glou. I serve you, madam.Your Graces are right welcome.

#### Scene II. 

### Before Gloucester's Castle

> Enter Kent and \[Oswald the\] Steward, severally

Osw. Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?  
Kent. Ay

Osw. Where may we set our horses?  
Kent. I' th' mire

Osw. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me

Kent. I love thee not

Osw. Why then, I care not for thee

Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care  
forme

Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not

Kent. Fellow, I know thee

Osw. What dost thou know me for?  
Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,  
proud,shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,  
whoreson,glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in  
way ofgood service, and art nothing but the composition of a  
knave,beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel  
bitch;one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny  
theleast syllable of thy addition

Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on onethat's neither known of thee nor knows thee!  
Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest  
me!Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy  
heelsbefore the King? \[Draws his sword.\] Draw, you rogue! for,  
thoughit be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!draw!  
Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee

Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,  
andtake Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her  
father.Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, yourascal! Come your ways!  
Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!  
Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!Strike! \[Beats him.\]  
Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!  

> Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall,                      Regan, Servants

Edm. How now? What's the matter? Parts \[them\]

Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh  
ye!Come on, young master!  
Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?  
Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?  
Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King  
Corn. What is your difference? Speak

Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord

Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You  
cowardlyrascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee

Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?  
Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not  
havemade him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the  
trade

Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?  
Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'dAt suit of his grey beard-  
Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, ifyou'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain  
intomortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my  
greybeard,' you wagtail?  
Corn. Peace, sirrah!You beastly knave, know you no reverence?  
Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege

Corn. Why art thou angry?  
Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwainWhich are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passionThat in the natures of their lords rebel,Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaksWith every gale and vary of their masters,Knowing naught (like dogs but following.A plague upon your epileptic visage!Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot) 
Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?  
Glou. How fell you out? Say that

Kent. No contraries hold more antipathyThan I and such a knave

Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?  
Kent. His countenance likes me not

Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers

Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.I have seen better faces in my timeThan stands on any shoulder that I seeBefore me at this instant

Corn. This is some fellowWho, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affectA saucy roughness, and constrains the garbQuite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.These kind of knaves I know which in this plainnessHarbour more craft and more corrupter endsThan twenty silly-ducking observantsThat stretch their duties nicely

Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,Under th' allowance of your great aspect,Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fireOn flickering Phoebus' front-  
Corn. What mean'st by this?  
Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. Iknow, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a  
plainaccent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't

Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?  
Osw. I never gave him any.It pleas'd the King his master very lateTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'dAnd put upon him such a deal of manThat worthied him, got praises of the KingFor him attempting who was self-subdu'd;And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,Drew on me here again

Kent. None of these rogues and cowardsBut Ajax is their fool

Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,We'll teach you-  
Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;On whose employment I was sent to you.You shall do small respect, show too bold maliceAgainst the grace and person of my master,Stocking his messenger

Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,There shall he sit till noon

Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!  
Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,You should not use me so

Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will

Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colourOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!                                        Stocks brought out

Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.His fault is much, and the good King his masterWill check him for't. Your purpos'd low correctionIs such as basest and contemn'dest wretchesFor pilf'rings and most common trespassesAre punish'd with. The King must take it illThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,Should have him thus restrain'd

Corn. I'll answer that

Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-                               \[Kent is put in the stocks.\]Come, my good lord, away.                      

> Exeunt \[all but Gloucester and Kent\]

Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,Whose disposition, all the world well knows,Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee

Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.Give you good morrow!  
Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken

> Exit

Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,Thou out of heaven's benediction com'stTo the warm sun!Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,That by thy comfortable beams I mayPeruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miraclesBut misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,Who hath most fortunately been inform'dOf my obscured course- and \[reads\] 'shall find timeFrom this enormous state, seeking to giveLosses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to beholdThis shameful lodging.Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.                                                    Sleeps

#### Scene III. 

### The open country

> Enter Edgar

Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,And by the happy hollow of a treeEscap'd the hunt. No port is free, no placeThat guard and most unusual vigilanceDoes not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,I will preserve myself; and am bethoughtTo take the basest and most poorest shapeThat ever penury, in contempt of man,Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,And with presented nakedness outfaceThe winds and persecutions of the sky.The country gives me proof and precedentOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare armsPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;And with this horrible object, from low farms,Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.

#### Scene IV. 

### Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks

> Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman

Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,And not send back my messenger

Gent. As I learn'd,The night before there was no purpose in themOf this remove

Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!  
Lear. Ha!Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?  
Kent. No, my lord

Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by  
thehead, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and  
menby th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wearswooden nether-stocks

Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistookTo set thee here?  
Kent. It is both he and she-Your son and daughter

Lear. No

Kent. Yes

Lear. No, I say

Kent. I say yea

Lear. No, no, they would not!  
Kent. Yes, they have

Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!  
Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!  
Lear. They durst not do't;They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murtherTo do upon respect such violent outrage.Resolve me with all modest haste which wayThou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,Coming from us

Kent. My lord, when at their homeI did commend your Highness' letters to them,Ere I was risen from the place that show'dMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forthFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,Which presently they read; on whose contents,They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,Commanded me to follow and attendThe leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,And meeting here the other messenger,Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-Being the very fellow which of lateDisplay'd so saucily against your Highness-Having more man than wit about me, drew.He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.Your son and daughter found this trespass worthThe shame which here it suffers

Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way

    Fathers that wear rags       Do make their children blind;     But fathers that bear bags       Shall see their children kind.     Fortune, that arrant whore,     Ne'er turns the key to th' poor

   But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thydaughters as thou canst tell in a year

Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?  
Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within

Lear. Follow me not;Stay here. 

> Exit

Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?  
Kent. None.How chance the King comes with so small a number?  
Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,thou'dst well deserv'd it

Kent. Why, fool?  
Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's  
nolabouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led  
bytheir eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among  
twentybut can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a  
greatwheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with  
followingit; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee  
after.When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine  
again. Iwould have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.     That sir which serves and seeks for gain,       And follows but for form,     Will pack when it begins to rain       And leave thee in the storm.     But I will tarry; the fool will stay,       And let the wise man fly.     The knave turns fool that runs away;       The fool no knave, perdy

Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?  
Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool

> Enter Lear and Gloucester

Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-The images of revolt and flying off!Fetch me a better answer

Glou. My dear lord,You know the fiery quality of the Duke,How unremovable and fix'd he isIn his own course

Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife

Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so

Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?  
Glou. Ay, my good lord

Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear fatherWould with his daughter speak, commands her service.Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-No, but not yet! May be he is not well.Infirmity doth still neglect all officeWhereto our health is bound. We are not ourselvesWhen nature, being oppress'd, commands the mindTo suffer with the body. I'll forbear;And am fallen out with my more headier will,To take the indispos'd and sickly fitFor the sound man.- Death on my state! WhereforeShould be sit here? This act persuades meThat this remotion of the Duke and herIs practice only. Give me my servant forth.Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drumTill it cry sleep to death

Glou. I would have all well betwixt you. 

> Exit

Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!  
Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when  
sheput 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs  
witha stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother  
that,in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay

> Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants

Lear. Good morrow to you both

Corn. Hail to your Grace!                                  Kent here set at liberty

Reg. I am glad to see your Highness

Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reasonI have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,Sepulchring an adultress. \[To Kent\] O, are you free?Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tiedSharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!                              \[Lays his hand on his heart.\]I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believeWith how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!  
Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hopeYou less know how to value her desertThan she to scant her duty

Lear. Say, how is that?  
Reg. I cannot think my sister in the leastWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchanceShe have restrain'd the riots of your followers,'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,As clears her from all blame

Lear. My curses on her!  
Reg. O, sir, you are old!Nature in you stands on the very vergeOf her confine. You should be rul'd, and ledBy some discretion that discerns your stateBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray youThat to our sister you do make return;Say you have wrong'd her, sir

Lear. Ask her forgiveness?Do you but mark how this becomes the house:'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. \[Kneels.\]Age is unnecessary. On my knees I begThat you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'  
Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.Return you to my sister

Lear. \[rises\] Never, Regan!She hath abated me of half my train;Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!  
Corn. Fie, sir, fie!  
Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,To fall and blast her pride!  
Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on meWhen the rash mood is on

Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.Thy tender-hefted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thineDo comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And, in conclusion, to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in. Thou better know'stThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,Wherein I thee endow'd

Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.                                             Tucket within

Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?  
Corn. What trumpet's that?  
Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,That she would soon be here

> Enter \[Oswald the\] Steward

   Is your lady come?  
Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed prideDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.Out, varlet, from my sight!  
Corn. What means your Grace?  

> Enter Goneril

Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hopeThou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!If you do love old men, if your sweet swayAllow obedience- if yourselves are old,Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!\[To Goneril\] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?  
Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?All's not offence that indiscretion findsAnd dotage terms so

Lear. O sides, you are too tough!Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?  
Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disordersDeserv'd much less advancement

Lear. You? Did you?  
Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.If, till the expiration of your month,You will return and sojourn with my sister,Dismissing half your train, come then to me.I am now from home, and out of that provisionWhich shall be needful for your entertainment

Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?No, rather I abjure all roofs, and chooseTo wage against the enmity o' th' air,To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless tookOur youngest born, I could as well be broughtTo knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension begTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpterTo this detested groom. \[Points at Oswald.\]  
Gon. At your choice, sir

Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.We'll no more meet, no more see one another.But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,A plague sore, an embossed carbuncleIn my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shootNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,I and my hundred knights

Reg. Not altogether so.I look'd not for you yet, nor am providedFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;For those that mingle reason with your passionMust be content to think you old, and so-But she knows what she does

Lear. Is this well spoken?  
Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?Is it not well? What should you need of more?Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and dangerSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How in one houseShould many people, under two commands,Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible

Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendanceFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?  
Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,We could control them. If you will come to me(For now I spy a danger), I entreat youTo bring but five-and-twenty. To no moreWill I give place or notice

Lear. I gave you all-  
Reg. And in good time you gave it!  
Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;But kept a reservation to be followedWith such a number. What, must I come to youWith five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?  
Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me

Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'dWhen others are more wicked; not being the worstStands in some rank of praise. \[To Goneril\] I'll go with  
thee.Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,And thou art twice her love

Gon. Hear, me, my lord.What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,To follow in a house where twice so manyHave a command to tend you?  
Reg. What need one?  
Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous.Allow not nature more than nature needs,Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:If only to go warm were gorgeous,Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'stWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,As full of grief as age; wretched in both.If it be you that stirs these daughters' heartsAgainst their father, fool me not so muchTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,And let not women's weapons, water drops,Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!I will have such revenges on you bothThat all the world shall- I will do such things-What they are yet, I know not; but they shall beThe terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.No, I'll not weep.I have full cause of weeping, but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flawsOr ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!         

> Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and                                                   tempest

Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm

Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's peopleCannot be well bestow'd

Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from restAnd must needs taste his folly

Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,But not one follower

Gon. So am I purpos'd.Where is my Lord of Gloucester?  
Corn. Followed the old man forth

> Enter Gloucester

   He is return'd

Glou. The King is in high rage

Corn. Whither is he going?  
Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither

Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself

Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay

Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak windsDo sorely ruffle. For many miles aboutThere's scarce a bush

Reg. O, sir, to wilful menThe injuries that they themselves procureMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.He is attended with a desperate train,And what they may incense him to, being aptTo have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear

Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm

> Exeunt.

## ACT III. 

#### Scene I. 

### A heath

Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors

Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?  
Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly

Kent. I know you. Where's the King?  
Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,Catch in their fury and make nothing of;Strives in his little world of man to outscornThe to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,The lion and the belly-pinched wolfKeep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,And bids what will take all

Kent. But who is with him?  
Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjestHis heart-struck injuries

Kent. Sir, I do know you,And dare upon the warrant of my noteCommend a dear thing to you. There is division(Although as yet the face of it be cover'dWith mutual cunning 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;Who have (as who have not, that their great starsThron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,Which are to France the spies and speculationsIntelligent of our state. What hath been seen,Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,Or the hard rein which both of them have borneAgainst the old kind King, or something deeper,Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-But, true it is, from France there comes a powerInto this scattered kingdom, who already,Wise in our negligence, have secret feetIn some of our best ports and are at pointTo show their open banner. Now to you:If on my credit you dare build so farTo make your speed to Dover, you shall findSome that will thank you, making just reportOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrowThe King hath cause to plain.I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,And from some knowledge and assurance offerThis office to you) 
Gent. I will talk further with you

Kent. No, do not.For confirmation that I am much moreThan my out-wall, open this purse and takeWhat it contains. If you shall see Cordelia(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,And she will tell you who your fellow isThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!I will go seek the King

Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?  
Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:That, when we have found the King (in which your painThat way, I'll this), he that first lights on himHolla the other.                                        

> Exeunt \[severally\]

### Another part of the heath

Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool

Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!You cataracts and hurricanoes, spoutTill you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,That makes ingrateful man!  
Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than  
thisrain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy  
daughtersblessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools

Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,You owe me no subscription. Then let fallYour horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.But yet I call you servile ministers,That will with two pernicious daughters joinYour high-engender'd battles 'gainst a headSo old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!  
Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good  
head-piece.     The codpiece that will house       Before the head has any,     The head and he shall louse:       So beggars marry many.     The man that makes his toe       What he his heart should make     Shall of a corn cry woe,       And turn his sleep to wake.For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in aglass

> Enter Kent

Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;I will say nothing

Kent. Who's there?  
Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and  
afool

Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love nightLove not such nights as these. The wrathful skiesGallow the very wanderers of the darkAnd make them keep their caves. Since I was man,Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I neverRemember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carryTh' affliction nor the fear

Lear. Let the great gods,That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,That hast within thee undivulged crimesUnwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtueThat art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shakeThat under covert and convenient seemingHast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,Rive your concealing continents, and cryThese dreadful summoners grace. I am a manMore sinn'd against than sinning

Kent. Alack, bareheaded?Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house(More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,Which even but now, demanding after you,Denied me to come in return, and forceTheir scanted courtesy) 
Lear. My wits begin to turn.Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?The art of our necessities is strange,That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heartThat's sorry yet for thee

Fool. \[sings\]  

    He that has and a little tiny wit-       With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-     Must make content with his fortunes fit,        For the rain it raineth every day

Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.                                    

> Exeunt \[Lear and Kent\]

Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak aprophecy ere I go:     When priests are more in word than matter;     When brewers mar their malt with water;     When nobles are their tailors' tutors,     No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;     When every case in law is right,     No squire in debt nor no poor knight;     When slanders do not live in tongues,     Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;     When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,     And bawds and whores do churches build:     Then shall the realm of Albion     Come to great confusion.     Then comes the time, who lives to see't,     That going shall be us'd with feet.This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time

### Gloucester's Castle

> Enter Gloucester and Edmund

Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!  
WhenI desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from  
methe use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetualdispleasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor  
anyway sustain him

Edm. Most savage and unnatural!  
Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the  
Dukes,and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter thisnight- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter  
inmy closet. These injuries the King now bears will be  
revengedhome; there's part of a power already footed; we must  
incline tothe King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you  
andmaintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of himperceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed

Though Idie for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old  
mastermust be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,  
Edmund.Pray you be careful. 

> Exit

Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the DukeInstantly know, and of that letter too.This seems a fair deserving, and must draw meThat which my father loses- no less than all.The younger rises when the old doth fall.

#### Scene IV. 

### The heath. Before a hovel

Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool

Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.The tyranny of the open night 's too roughFor nature to endure

Lear. Let me alone

Kent. Good my lord, enter here

Lear. Wilt break my heart?  
Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter

Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious stormInvades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;But where the greater malady is fix'd,The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,The body's delicate. The tempest in my mindDoth from my senses take all feeling elseSave what beats there. Filial ingratitude!Is it not as this mouth should tear this handFor lifting food to't? But I will punish home!No, I will weep no more. In such a night'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!No more of that

Kent. Good my lord, enter here

Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.This tempest will not give me leave to ponderOn things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.\[To the Fool\] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.                                               

> Exit \[Fool\].Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these? O, I have ta'enToo little care of this! Take physic, pomp;Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,That thou mayst shake the superflux to themAnd show the heavens more just

Edg. \[within\] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!  

> Enter Fool \[from the hovel\]

Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help  
me!  
Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?  
Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom

Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?Come forth

> Enter Edgar \[disguised as a madman\]

Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee. Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this? Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and there- and there again- and there! Storm still. Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all? Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd. Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters! Kent. He hath no daughters, sir. Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters. Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo! Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen. Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold. Lear. What hast thou been? Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair, wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine lov'd I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by. Storm still. Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's three on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here. \[Tears at his clothes.\] Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire

> Enter Gloucester with a torch

Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at  
curfew,and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white  
wheat,and hurts the poor creature of earth

     Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;      He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;         Bid her alight         And her troth plight,      And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!  

Kent. How fares your Grace?  
Lear. What's he?  
Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?  
Glou. What are you there? Your names?  
Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the  
todpole,the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,  
whenthe foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows  
theold rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of thestanding pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, andstock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to  
hisback, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons towear;  

    But mice and rats, and such small deer,     Have been Tom's food for seven long year

   Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!  
Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?  
Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!Modo he's call'd, and Mahu

Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,That it doth hate what gets it

Edg. Poor Tom 's acold

Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot sufferT' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.Though their injunction be to bar my doorsAnd let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you outAnd bring you where both fire and food is ready

Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher.What is the cause of thunder?  
Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house

Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.What is your study?  
Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin

Lear. Let me ask you one word in private

Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.His wits begin t' unsettle

Glou. Canst thou blame him?                                               Storm still.His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,I am almost mad myself. I had a son,Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my lifeBut lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!I do beseech your Grace-  
Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir.Noble philosopher, your company

Edg. Tom's acold

Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm

Lear. Come, let's in all

Kent. This way, my lord

Lear. With him!I will keep still with my philosopher

Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow

Glou. Take him you on

Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us

Lear. Come, good Athenian

Glou. No words, no words! hush

Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house

Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives  
way toloyalty, something fears me to think of

Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evildisposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,  
setawork by a reproveable badness in himself

Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him anintelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!  
thatthis treason were not- or not I the detector!  
Corn. Go with me to the Duchess

Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mightybusiness in hand

Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for ourapprehension

Edm. \[aside\] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff

Edg. Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in thelake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend

Fool. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman  
or ayeoman

Lear. A king, a king!  
Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for  
he's amad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him

Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spitsCome hizzing in upon 'em-  
Edg. The foul fiend bites my back

Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse'shealth, a boy's love, or a whore's oath

Lear. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.\[To Edgar\] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.\[To the Fool\] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you  
she-foxes!  
Edg. Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at  
trial,madam?  

Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me

Fool. Her boat hath a leak,        And she must not speak      Why she dares not come over to thee

Edg. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a  
nightingale.Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croaknot, black angel; I have no food for thee

Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?  
Lear. I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.\[To Edgar\] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.\[To the Fool\] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,Bench by his side. \[To Kent\] You are o' th' commission,Sit you too

Edg. Let us deal justly

    Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?       Thy sheep be in the corn;     And for one blast of thy minikin mouth       Thy sheep shall take no harm

   Purr! the cat is gray

Lear. Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath  
beforethis honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her  
father

Fool. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?  
Lear. She cannot deny it

Fool. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool

Lear. And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaimWhat store her heart is made on. Stop her there!Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?  
Edg. Bless thy five wits!  
Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience nowThat you so oft have boasted to retain?  
Edg. \[aside\] My tears begin to take his part so muchThey'll mar my counterfeiting

Lear. The little dogs and all,Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me

Edg. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!      Be thy mouth or black or white,      Tooth that poisons if it bite;      Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,      Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,      Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-      Tom will make them weep and wail;      For, with throwing thus my head,      Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and  
markettowns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry

Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about herheart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hardhearts? \[To Edgar\] You, sir- I entertain you for one of myhundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments

You'llsay they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd

Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile

Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so

Fool. And I'll go to bed at noon

Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?  
Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone

Glou. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.There is a litter ready; lay him in'tAnd drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meetBoth welcome and protection. Take up thy master.If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,With thine, and all that offer to defend him,Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!And follow me, that will to some provisionGive thee quick conduct

Kent. Oppressed nature sleeps.This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,Which, if convenience will not allow,Stand in hard cure. \[To the Fool\] Come, help to bear thy  
master.Thou must not stay behind

Glou. Come, come, away!                                    

> Exeunt \[all but Edgar\]

Edg. When we our betters see bearing our woes,We scarcely think our miseries our foes.Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,Leaving free things and happy shows behind;But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskipWhen grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.How light and portable my pain seems now,When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!Mark the high noises, and thyself bewrayWhen false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!Lurk, lurk. \[

Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?  
Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth

Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitorsLate footed in the kingdom?  
Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?Speak

Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,And not from one oppos'd

Corn. Cunning

Reg. And false

Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?  
Glou. To Dover

Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-  
Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that

Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course

Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?  
Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nailsPluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sisterIn his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.The sea, with such a storm as his bare headIn hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd upAnd quench'd the steeled fires.Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall seeThe winged vengeance overtake such children

Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot

Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!  
Corn. If you see vengeance-  
 Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;But better service have I never done youThan now to bid you hold

Reg. How now, you dog?  
 Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,I'ld shake it on this quarrel

Reg. What do you mean?  
Corn. My villain! Draw and fight

 Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger

Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?                   She takes a sword and runs at him behind

 Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye leftTo see some mischief on him. O! He dies

Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!Where is thy lustre now?  
Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of natureTo quit this horrid act

Reg. Out, treacherous villain!Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was heThat made the overture of thy treasons to us;Who is too good to pity thee

### The heath

> Enter Edgar

Edg. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.The lamentable change is from the best;The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worstOwes nothing to thy blasts

> Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man

   But who comes here?My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,Life would not yield to age

Old Man. O my good lord,I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,These fourscore years

Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.Thy comforts can do me no good at all;Thee they may hurt

Old Man. You cannot see your way

Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seenOur means secure us, and our mere defectsProve our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,The food of thy abused father's wrath!Might I but live to see thee in my touch,I'ld say I had eyes again!  
Old Man. How now? Who's there?  
Edg. \[aside\] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?I am worse than e'er I was

Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom

Edg. \[aside\] And worse I may be yet. The worst is notSo long as we can say 'This is the worst.'  
Old Man. Fellow, where goest?  
Glou. Is it a beggarman?  
Old Man. Madman and beggar too

Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,Which made me think a man a worm. My sonCame then into my mind, and yet my mindWas then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.They kill us for their sport

Edg. \[aside\] How should this be?Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!  
Glou. Is that the naked fellow?  
Old Man. Ay, my lord

Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sakeThou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twainI' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;And bring some covering for this naked soul,Who I'll entreat to lead me

Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad!  
Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.Above the rest, be gone

Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,Come on't what will. 

> Exit

Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-  
Edg. Poor Tom's acold. \[Aside\] I cannot daub it further

Glou. Come hither, fellow

Edg. \[aside\] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed

Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?  
Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath  
beenscar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,  
fromthe foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:  
oflust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,  
ofstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping andmowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women

So,bless thee, master!  
Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plaguesHave humbled to all strokes. That I am wretchedMakes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,That slaves your ordinance, that will not seeBecause he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;So distribution should undo excess,And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?  
Edg. Ay, master

Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending headLooks fearfully in the confined deep.Bring me but to the very brim of it,And I'll repair the misery thou dost bearWith something rich about me. From that placeI shall no leading need

Edg. Give me thy arm.Poor Tom shall lead thee.

Alb. O Goneril,You are not worth the dust which the rude windBlows in your face! I fear your disposition.That nature which contemns it originCannot be bordered certain in itself.She that herself will sliver and disbranchFrom her material sap, perforce must witherAnd come to deadly use

Gon. No more! The text is foolish

Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?A father, and a gracious aged man,Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.Could my good brother suffer you to do it?A man, a prince, by him so benefited!If that the heavens do not their visible spiritsSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,It will come,Humanity must perforce prey on itself,Like monsters of the deep

Gon. Milk-liver'd man!That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerningThine honour from thy suffering; that not know'stFools do those villains pity who are punish'dEre they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest'Alack, why does he so?'  
Alb. See thyself, devil!Proper deformity seems not in the fiendSo horrid as in woman

Gon. O vain fool!  
Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitnessTo let these hands obey my blood,They are apt enough to dislocate and tearThy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,A woman's shape doth shield thee

Alb. This shows you are above,You justicers, that these our nether crimesSo speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!Lose he his other eye?  
Gent. Both, both, my lord.This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.'Tis from your sister

### The French camp near Dover

> Enter Kent and a Gentleman

Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you  
thereason?  
Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since hiscoming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so  
muchfear and danger that his personal return was most required  
andnecessary

Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?  
Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far

Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration ofgrief?  
Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,And now and then an ample tear trill'd downHer delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queenOver her passion, who, most rebel-like,Sought to be king o'er her

Kent. O, then it mov'd her?  
Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow stroveWho should express her goodliest. You have seenSunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tearsWere like, a better way. Those happy smiletsThat play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to knowWhat guests were in her eyes, which parted thenceAs pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,If all could so become it

Kent. Made she no verbal question?  
Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of fatherPantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shookThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,And clamour moisten'd. Then away she startedTo deal with grief alone

Kent. It is the stars,The stars above us, govern our conditions;Else one self mate and mate could not begetSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?  
Gent. No

Kent. Was this before the King return'd?  
Gent. No, since

Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;Who sometime, in his better tune, remembersWhat we are come about, and by no meansWill yield to see his daughter

Gent. Why, good sir?  
Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd herTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rightsTo his dog-hearted daughters- these things stingHis mind so venomously that burning shameDetains him from Cordelia

Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!  
Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?  
Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot

Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master LearAnd leave you to attend him. Some dear causeWill in concealment wrap me up awhile.When I am known aright, you shall not grieveLending me this acquaintance. I pray you goAlong with me.

O dear father,It is thy business that I go about.Therefore great FranceMy mourning and important tears hath pitied.No blown ambition doth our arms incite,But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.Soon may I hear and see him!

#### Scene V. 

### Gloucester's Castle

> Enter Regan and \[Oswald the\] Steward

Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?  
Osw. Ay, madam

Reg. Himself in person there?  
Osw. Madam, with much ado.Your sister is the better soldier

Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?  
Osw. No, madam

Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?  
Osw. I know not, lady

Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,To let him live. Where he arrives he movesAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,In pity of his misery, to dispatchHis nighted life; moreover, to descryThe strength o' th' enemy

Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter

Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.The ways are dangerous

Osw. I may not, madam.My lady charg'd my duty in this business

Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not youTransport her purposes by word? Belike,Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-Let me unseal the letter

Osw. Madam, I had rather-  
Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;I am sure of that; and at her late being hereShe gave strange eliads and most speaking looksTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom

Osw. I, madam?  
Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.Therefore I do advise you take this note.My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,And more convenient is he for my handThan for your lady's. You may gather more.If you do find him, pray you give him this;And when your mistress hears thus much from you,I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.So farewell.If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,Preferment falls on him that cuts him off

Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should showWhat party I do follow

Reg. Fare thee well.

#### Scene VI. 

### The country near Dover

> Enter Gloucester, and Edgar \[like a Peasant\]

Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?  
Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour

Glou. Methinks the ground is even

Edg. Horrible steep.Hark, do you hear the sea?  
Glou. No, truly

Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfectBy your eyes' anguish

Glou. So may it be indeed.Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'stIn better phrase and matter than thou didst

Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'dBut in my garments

Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken

Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearfulAnd dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!The crows and choughs that wing the midway airShow scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway downHangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.The fishermen that walk upon the beachAppear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoyAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surgeThat on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafesCannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sightTopple down headlong

Glou. Set me where you stand

Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a footOf th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright

Glou. Let go my hand.Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewelWell worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and godsProsper it with thee! Go thou further off;Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going

Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir

Glou. With all my heart

Edg. \[aside\]. Why I do trifle thus with his despairIs done to cure it

Glou. O you mighty gods! He kneels.This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,Shake patiently my great affliction off.If I could bear it longer and not fallTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,My snuff and loathed part of nature shouldBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!Now, fellow, fare thee well.                             He falls \[forward and swoons\]

Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-And yet I know not how conceit may robThe treasury of life when life itselfYields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.What are you, sir?  
Glou. Away, and let me die

Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,So many fadom down precipitating,Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.Ten masts at each make not the altitudeWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again

Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?  
Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so farCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up

Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefitTo end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfortWhen misery could beguile the tyrant's rageAnd frustrate his proud will

Edg. Give me your arm.Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand

Glou. Too well, too well

Edg. This is above all strangeness.Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was thatWhich parted from you?  
Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar

Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyesWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,Think that the clearest gods, who make them honoursOf men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee

Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bearAffliction till it do cry out itself'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,I took it for a man. Often 'twould say'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place

Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts

> Enter Lear, mad, \[fantastically dressed with weeds\]

   But who comes here?The safer sense will ne'er accommodateHis master thus

Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;I am the King himself

Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!  
Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your pressmoney. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw  
mea clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this  
pieceof toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove  
iton a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!  
i'th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word

Edg. Sweet marjoram

Lear. Pass

Glou. I know that voice

Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a  
dog,and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black oneswere there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'  
and'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet meonce, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder  
wouldnot peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt  
'emout. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I  
waseverything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof

Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.Is't not the King?  
Lear. Ay, every inch a king!When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?Adultery?Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.The wren goes to't, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight.Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard sonWas kinder to his father than my daughtersGot 'tween the lawful sheets.To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.Behold yond simp'ring dame,Whose face between her forks presageth snow,That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure's name.The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to'tWith a more riotous appetite.Down from the waist they are Centaurs,Though women all above.But to the girdle do the gods inherit,Beneath is all the fiend's.There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,  
pah!Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten myimagination. There's money for thee

Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!  
Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality

Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great worldShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?  
Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at  
me?No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou thischallenge; mark but the penning of it

Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one

Edg. \[aside\] I would not take this from report. It is,And my heart breaks at it

Lear. Read

Glou. What, with the case of eyes?  
Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor  
nomoney in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your  
pursein a light. Yet you see how this world goes

Glou. I see it feelingly

Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no  
eyes.Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yondsimple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,  
handy-dandy,which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen afarmer's dog bark at a beggar?  
Glou. Ay, sir

Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst  
beholdthe great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kindFor which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.Take that of me, my friend, who have the powerTo seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyesAnd, like a scurvy politician, seemTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So

Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!Reason, in madness!  
Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark

Glou. Alack, alack the day!  
Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools. This' a good block.It were a delicate stratagem to shoeA troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!  

> Enter a Gentleman \[with Attendants\]

Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,Your most dear daughter-  
Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am evenThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;I am cut to th' brains

Gent. You shall have anything

Lear. No seconds? All myself?Why, this would make a man a man of salt,To use his eyes for garden waterpots,Ay, and laying autumn's dust

Gent. Good sir-  
Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;My masters, know you that?  
Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you

Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get  
itby running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!                         

> Exit running. \[Attendants follow.\]  

Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughterWho redeems nature from the general curseWhich twain have brought her to

Edg. Hail, gentle sir

Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?  
Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?  
Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears thatWhich can distinguish sound

Edg. But, by your favour,How near's the other army?  
Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descryStands on the hourly thought

Edg. I thank you sir. That's all

Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,Her army is mov'd on

Edg. I thank you, sir                                          

> Exit \[Gentleman\]

Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;Let not my worser spirit tempt me againTo die before you please!  
Edg. Well pray you, father

Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?  
Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;I'll lead you to some biding

Glou. Hearty thanks.The bounty and the benison of heavenTo boot, and boot!  

> Enter \[Oswald the\] Steward

Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd fleshTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,Briefly thyself remember. The sword is outThat must destroy thee

Glou. Now let thy friendly handPut strength enough to't.                                        \[Edgar interposes.\]  
Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant,Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!Lest that th' infection of his fortune takeLike hold on thee. Let go his arm

Edg. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion

Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest!  
Edg. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An  
chudha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo  
long as'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep  
out,che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be  
theharder. Chill be plain with you

Osw. Out, dunghill!                                                They fight

Edg. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your  
foins.                                            \[Oswald falls.\]  
Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,And give the letters which thou find'st about meTo Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him outUpon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!                                                   He dies

Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,As duteous to the vices of thy mistressAs badness would desire

Glou. What, is he dead?  
Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks ofMay be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorryHe had no other deathsman. Let us see.Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;Their papers, is more lawful. Reads the letter

 'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have manyopportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time  
andplace will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if  
hereturn the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed myjail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply  
theplace for your labour.      'Your (wife, so I would say affectionate servant,  ) 
'Goneril.'

   O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,And the exchange my brother! Here in the sandsThee I'll rake up, the post unsanctifiedOf murtherous lechers; and in the mature timeWith this ungracious paper strike the sightOf the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis wellThat of thy death and business I can tell

Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,That I stand up, and have ingenious feelingOf my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,And woes by wrong imaginations loseThe knowledge of themselves.                                           A drum afar off

Edg. Give me your hand.Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

#### Scene VII. 

### A tent in the French camp

> Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman

Cor. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and workTo match thy goodness? My life will be too shortAnd every measure fail me

Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.All my reports go with the modest truth;Nor more nor clipp'd, but so

Cor. Be better suited.These weeds are memories of those worser hours.I prithee put them off

Kent. Pardon, dear madam.Yet to be known shortens my made intent.My boon I make it that you know me notTill time and I think meet

Cor. Then be't so, my good lord. \[To the Doctor\] How, does the  
King?  
Doct. Madam, sleeps still

Cor. O you kind gods,Cure this great breach in his abused nature!Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind upOf this child-changed father!  
Doct. So please your MajestyThat we may wake the King? He hath slept long

Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceedI' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?  

> Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants

Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleepWe put fresh garments on him

Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.I doubt not of his temperance

Cor. Very well.                                                     Music

Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!  
Cor. O my dear father, restoration hangThy medicine on my lips, and let this kissRepair those violent harms that my two sistersHave in thy reverence made!  
Kent. Kind and dear princess!  
Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakesHad challeng'd pity of them. Was this a faceTo be oppos'd against the warring winds?To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?In the most terrible and nimble strokeOf quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,Though he had bit me, should have stood that nightAgainst my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at onceHad not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him

Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest

Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?  
Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am boundUpon a wheel of fire, that mine own tearsDo scald like molten lead

Cor. Sir, do you know me?  
Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?  
Cor. Still, still, far wide!  
Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile

Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,To see another thus. I know not what to say.I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'dOf my condition!  
Cor. O, look upon me, sir,And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.No, sir, you must not kneel

Lear. Pray, do not mock me.I am a very foolish fond old man,Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;And, to deal plainly,I fear I am not in my perfect mind.Methinks I should know you, and know this man;Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorantWhat place this is; and all the skill I haveRemembers not these garments; nor I know notWhere I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;For (as I am a man I think this ladyTo be my child Cordelia) 
Cor. And so I am! I am!  
Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.If you have poison for me, I will drink it.I know you do not love me; for your sistersHave, as I do remember, done me wrong.You have some cause, they have not

Cor. No cause, no cause

Lear. Am I in France?  
Kent. In your own kingdom, sir

Lear. Do not abuse me

Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rageYou see is kill'd in him; and yet it is dangerTo make him even o'er the time he has lost.Desire him to go in. Trouble him no moreTill further settling

Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?  
Lear. You must bear with me.Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.                         

> Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman

Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so  
slain?  
Kent. Most certain, sir

Gent. Who is conductor of his people?  
Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester

Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of  
Kentin Germany

Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers  
ofthe kingdom approach apace

Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.Fare you well, sir. \[ Exit.\]  

Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

### The British camp near Dover

> Enter, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Regan, Gentleman, and Soldiers

Edm. Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,Or whether since he is advis'd by aughtTo change the course. He's full of alterationAnd self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.                                         

\[ Exit an Officer.\]  

Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried

Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam

Reg. Now, sweet lord,You know the goodness I intend upon you.Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-Do you not love my sister?  
Edm. In honour'd love

Reg. But have you never found my brother's wayTo the forfended place?  
Edm. That thought abuses you

Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunctAnd bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers

Edm. No, by mine honour, madam

Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,Be not familiar with her

Edm. Fear me not.She and the Duke her husband!  

> Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers

Gon. \[aside\] I had rather lose the battle than that sisterShould loosen him and me

Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,With others whom the rigour of our stateForc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,I never yet was valiant. For this business,It toucheth us as France invades our land,Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,Most just and heavy causes make oppose

Edm. Sir, you speak nobly

Reg. Why is this reason'd?  
Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;For these domestic and particular broilsAre not the question here

Alb. Let's then determineWith th' ancient of war on our proceeding

Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent

Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?  
Gon. No

Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us

Gon. \[aside\] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go

\[As they are going out,\] enter Edgar \[disguised\]

Edg. If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,Hear me one word

Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.                         

> Exeunt \[all but Albany and Edgar\]

Edg. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.If you have victory, let the trumpet soundFor him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,I can produce a champion that will proveWhat is avouched there. If you miscarry,Your business of the world hath so an end,And machination ceases. Fortune love you!  
Alb. Stay till I have read the letter

Edg. I was forbid it.When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,And I'll appear again

Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.                                              

> Exit \[Edgar\]

> Enter Edmund

Edm. The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.Here is the guess of their true strength and forcesBy diligent discovery; but your hasteIs now urg'd on you

Alb. We will greet the time. 

> Exit

Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love;Each jealous of the other, as the stungAre of the adder. Which of them shall I take?Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,If both remain alive. To take the widowExasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;And hardly shall I carry out my side,Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll useHis countenance for the battle, which being done,Let her who would be rid of him deviseHis speedy taking off. As for the mercyWhich he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-The battle done, and they within our power,Shall never see his pardon; for my stateStands on me to defend, not to debate.

#### Scene III. 

### The British camp, near Dover

> Enter, in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund; Lear and Cordelia as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain

Edm. Some officers take them away. Good guardUntil their greater pleasures first be knownThat are to censure them

Cor. We are not the firstWho with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?  
Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel downAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laughAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor roguesTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-And take upon 's the mystery of things,As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great onesThat ebb and flow by th' moon

Edm. Take them away

Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?He that parts us shall bring a brand from heavenAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.Come. 

> Exeunt \[Lear and Cordelia, guarded\]

Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark.Take thou this note \[gives a paper\]. Go follow them to  
prison.One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dostAs this instructs thee, thou dost make thy wayTo noble fortunes. Know thou this, that menAre as the time is. To be tender-mindedDoes not become a sword. Thy great employmentWill not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,Or thrive by other means

Capt. I'll do't, my lord

Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it soAs I have set it down

Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;If it be man's work, I'll do't. 

> Exit

> Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers

Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,And fortune led you well. You have the captivesWho were the opposites of this day's strife.We do require them of you, so to use themAs we shall find their merits and our safetyMay equally determine

Edm. Sir, I thought it fitTo send the old and miserable KingTo some retention and appointed guard;Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,To pluck the common bosom on his sideAnd turn our impress'd lances in our eyesWhich do command them. With him I sent the Queen,My reason all the same; and they are readyTo-morrow, or at further space, t' appearWhere you shall hold your session. At this timeWe sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'dBy those that feel their sharpness.The question of Cordelia and her fatherRequires a fitter place

Alb. Sir, by your patience,I hold you but a subject of this war,Not as a brother

Reg. That's as we list to grace him.Methinks our pleasure might have been demandedEre you had spoke so far. He led our powers,Bore the commission of my place and person,The which immediacy may well stand upAnd call itself your brother

Gon. Not so hot!In his own grace he doth exalt himselfMore than in your addition

Reg. In my rightsBy me invested, he compeers the best

Gon. That were the most if he should husband you

Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets

Gon. Holla, holla!That eye that told you so look'd but asquint

Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answerFrom a full-flowing stomach. General,Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.Witness the world that I create thee hereMy lord and master

Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?  
Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will

Edm. Nor in thine, lord

Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes

Reg. \[to Edmund\] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine

Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest theeOn capital treason; and, in thine attaint,This gilded serpent \[points to Goneril\]. For your claim,  
fair   sister,I bar it in the interest of my wife.'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,And I, her husband, contradict your banes.If you will marry, make your loves to me;My lady is bespoke

Gon. An interlude!  
Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.If none appear to prove upon thy personThy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,There is my pledge \[throws down a glove\]! I'll prove it on  
thy   heart,Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing lessThan I have here proclaim'd thee

Reg. Sick, O, sick!  
Gon. \[aside\] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine

Edm. There's my exchange \[throws down a glove\]. What in the  
world   he isThat names me traitor, villain-like he lies.Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,On him, on you, who not? I will maintainMy truth and honour firmly

Alb. A herald, ho!  
Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!  
Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,All levied in my name, have in my nameTook their discharge

Reg. My sickness grows upon me

Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.                                         \[

> Exit Regan, led.\]  
> Enter a Herald

   Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,And read out this

Capt. Sound, trumpet! A trumpet sounds

Her. (reads 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists  ) 
ofthe army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of  
Gloucester,that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third  
soundof the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'  

Edm. Sound! First trumpet

Her. Again! Second trumpet

Her. Again! Third trumpet.                                    Trumpet answers within

> Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him

Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appearsUpon this call o' th' trumpet

Her. What are you?Your name, your quality? and why you answerThis present summons?  
Edg. Know my name is lost;By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.Yet am I noble as the adversaryI come to cope

Alb. Which is that adversary?  
Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?  
Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?  
Edg. Draw thy sword,That, if my speech offend a noble heart,Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,My oath, and my profession. I protest-Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;And from th' extremest upward of thy headTo the descent and dust beneath thy foot,A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bentTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,Thou liest

Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,What safe and nicely I might well delayBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-This sword of mine shall give them instant wayWhere they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!                            Alarums. Fight. \[Edmund falls.\]  
Alb. Save him, save him!  
Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answerAn unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,But cozen'd and beguil'd

Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,Or with this paper shall I stop it. \[Shows her her letter toEdmund.\]- \[To Edmund\]. Hold, sir.\[To Goneril\] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it

Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.Who can arraign me for't?  
Alb. Most monstrous!Know'st thou this paper?  
Gon. Ask me not what I know. 

> Exit

Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.                                         \[

> Exit an Officer.\]  

Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,And more, much more. The time will bring it out.'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thouThat hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,I do forgive thee

Edg. Let's exchange charity.I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.My name is Edgar and thy father's son.The gods are just, and of our pleasant vicesMake instruments to scourge us.The dark and vicious place where thee he gotCost him his eyes

Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.The wheel is come full circle; I am here

Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesyA royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.Let sorrow split my heart if ever IDid hate thee, or thy father!  
Edg. Worthy prince, I know't

Alb. Where have you hid yourself?How have you known the miseries of your father?  
Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!The bloody proclamation to escapeThat follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!That with the pain of death would hourly dieRather than die at once! taught me to shiftInto a madman's rags, t' assume a semblanceThat very dogs disdain'd; and in this habitMet I my father with his bleeding rings,Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto himUntil some half hour past, when I was arm'd,Not sure, though hoping of this good success,I ask'd his blessing, and from first to lastTold him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,Burst smilingly) 
Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;You look as you had something more to say

Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;For I am almost ready to dissolve,Hearing of this

Edg. This would have seem'd a periodTo such as love not sorrow; but another,To amplify too much, would make much more,And top extremity.Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,Who, having seen me in my worst estate,Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, findingWho 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong armsHe fastened on my neck, and bellowed outAs he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;Told the most piteous tale of Lear and himThat ever ear receiv'd; which in recountingHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of lifeBegan to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,And there I left him tranc'd

Alb. But who was this?  
Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguiseFollowed his enemy king and did him serviceImproper for a slave

> Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife

Gent. Help, help! O, help!  
Edg. What kind of help?  
Alb. Speak, man

Edg. What means that bloody knife?  
Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!  
Alb. Who dead? Speak, man

Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sisterBy her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it

Edm. I was contracted to them both. All threeNow marry in an instant

> Enter Kent

Edg. Here comes Kent

Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.                                          \[

> Exit Gentleman.\]This judgement of the heavens, that makes us trembleTouches us not with pity. O, is this he?The time will not allow the complimentThat very manners urges

Kent. I am comeTo bid my king and master aye good night.Is he not here?  
Alb. Great thing of us forgot!Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?            The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.Seest thou this object, Kent?  
Kent. Alack, why thus?  
Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.The one the other poisoned for my sake,And after slew herself

Alb. Even so. Cover their faces

Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send(Be brief in't to the castle; for my writIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.Nay, send in time) 
Alb. Run, run, O, run!  
Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? SendThy token of reprieve

Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;Give it the Captain

Alb. Haste thee for thy life. \[

> Exit Edgar.\]  

Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and meTo hang Cordelia in the prison andTo lay the blame upon her own despairThat she fordid herself

Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.                                     \[Edmund is borne off.\]  

  Enter Lear, with Cordelia \[dead\] in his arms, \[Edgar,  
Captain,                   and others following\]

Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them soThat heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!I know when one is dead, and when one lives.She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,Why, then she lives

Kent. Is this the promis'd end?  
Edg. Or image of that horror?  
Alb. Fall and cease!  
Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,It is a chance which does redeem all sorrowsThat ever I have felt

Kent. O my good master!  
Lear. Prithee away!  
Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend

Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee

Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did

Lear. Did I not, fellow?I have seen the day, with my good biting falchionI would have made them skip. I am old now,And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight

Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,One of them we behold

Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?  
Kent. The same-Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?  
Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten

Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-  
Lear. I'll see that straight

Kent. That from your first of difference and decayHave followed your sad steps

Lear. You're welcome hither

Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,And desperately are dead

Lear. Ay, so I think

Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is itThat we present us to him

Edg. Very bootless

> Enter a Captain

Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord

Alb. That's but a trifle here.You lords and noble friends, know our intent.What comfort to this great decay may comeShall be applied. For us, we will resign,During the life of this old Majesty,To him our absolute power; \[to Edgar and Kent\] you to your   rights;With boot, and Such addition as your honoursHave more than merited.- All friends shall tasteThe wages of their virtue, and all foesThe cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!  
Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,Never, never, never, never, never!Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!Look there, look there! He dies

Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!  
Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!  
Edg. Look up, my lord

Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates himThat would upon the rack of this tough worldStretch him out longer

Edg. He is gone indeed

Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.He but usurp'd his life

Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present businessIs general woe. \[To Kent and Edgar\] Friends of my soul, you   twainRule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain

Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.My master calls me; I must not say no

Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.The oldest have borne most; we that are youngShall never see so much, nor live so long.
