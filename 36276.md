THE MEANING OF RELATIVITYLECTURE ISPACE AND TIME IN PRE-RELATIVITYPHYSICSThetheory of relativity is intimately connected with the theoryof space and time. I shall therefore begin with a brief investi-
gation of the origin of our ideas of space and time, although in
doing so I know that I introduce a controversial subject. The
object of all science, whether natural science or psychology, is
to co-ordinate our experiences and to bring them into a logical
system. How are our customary ideas of space and time related
to the character of our experiences?The experiences of an individual appear to us arranged in aseries of events; in this series the single events which we remem-
ber appear to be ordered according to the criterion of “earlier”
and “later,” which cannot be analysed further. There exists,
therefore, for the individual, an I-time, or subjective time. This
in itself is not measurable. I can, indeed, associate numbers with
the events, in such a way that a greater number is associated
with the later event than with an earlier one; but the nature of
this association may be quite arbitrary. This association I can
define by means of a clock by comparing the order of events fur-
nished by the clock with the order of the given series of events.
We understand by a clock something which provides a series of
events which can be counted, and which has other properties of
which we shall speak later.1
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY2By the aid of speech different individuals can, to a certainextent, compare their experiences. In this way it is shown that
certain sense perceptions of different individuals correspond to
each other, while for other sense perceptions no such correspon-
dence can be established. We are accustomed to regard as real
those sense perceptions which are common to different individu-
als, and which therefore are, in a measure, impersonal. The nat-
ural sciences, and in particular, the most fundamental of them,
physics, deal with such sense perceptions. The conception of
physical bodies, in particular of rigid bodies, is a relatively con-
stant complex of such sense perceptions. A clock is also a body,
or a system, in the same sense, with the additional property that
the series of events which it counts is formed of elements all of
which can be regarded as equal.The only justification for our concepts and system of con-cepts is that they serve to represent the complex of our experi-
ences; beyond this they have no legitimacy. I am convinced that
the philosophers have had a harmful effect upon the progress
of scientific thinking in removing certain fundamental concepts
from the domain of empiricism, where they are under our con-
trol, to the intangible heights of the a priori. For even if it should
appear that the universe of ideas cannot be deduced from ex-
perience by logical means, but is, in a sense, a creation of the
human mind, without which no science is possible, nevertheless
this universe of ideas is just as little independent of the nature
of our experiences as clothes are of the form of the human body.
This is particularly true of our concepts of time and space, which
physicists have been obliged by the facts to bring down from the
Olympus of the a priori in order to adjust them and put them
in a serviceable condition.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS3We now come to our concepts and judgments of space. Itis essential here also to pay strict attention to the relation of
experience to our concepts. It seems to me that Poincar´e clearlyrecognized the truth in the account he gave in his book, “La
Science et l’Hypothese.” Among all the changes which we can
perceive in a rigid body those are marked by their simplicity
which can be made reversibly by an arbitrary motion of the
body; Poincar´e calls these, changes in position. By means ofsimple changes in position we can bring two bodies into contact.
The theorems of congruence, fundamental in geometry, have to
do with the laws that govern such changes in position. For the
concept of space the following seems essential. We can form new
bodies by bringing bodiesB, C, . . . up to body A; we say thatwe continue bodyA. We can continue body A in such a way thatit comes into contact with any other body,X. The ensemble ofall continuations of bodyA we can designate as the “space ofthe bodyA.” Then it is true that all bodies are in the “space ofthe (arbitrarily chosen) bodyA.” In this sense we cannot speakof space in the abstract, but only of the “space belonging to a
bodyA.” The earth’s crust plays such a dominant rˆole in ourdaily life in judging the relative positions of bodies that it has
led to an abstract conception of space which certainly cannot be
defended. In order to free ourselves from this fatal error we shall
speak only of “bodies of reference,” or “space of reference.” It
was only through the theory of general relativity that refinement
of these concepts became necessary, as we shall see later.I shall not go into detail concerning those properties of thespace of reference which lead to our conceiving points as ele-
ments of space, and space as a continuum. Nor shall I attempt
to analyse further the properties of space which justify the con-
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY4ception of continuous series of points, or lines. If these concepts
are assumed, together with their relation to the solid bodies of
experience, then it is easy to say what we mean by the three-
dimensionality of space; to each point three numbers,x1,x2,x3(co-ordinates), may be associated, in such a way that this asso-
ciation is uniquely reciprocal, and thatx1,x2andx3vary con-tinuously when the point describes a continuous series of points
(a line).It is assumed in pre-relativity physics that the laws of theorientation of ideal rigid bodies are consistent with Euclidean
geometry. What this means may be expressed as follows: Two
points marked on a rigid body form an interval. Such an interval
can be oriented at rest, relatively to our space of reference, in
a multiplicity of ways. If, now, the points of this space can
be referred to co-ordinatesx1,x2,x3, in such a way that thedifferences of the co-ordinates, ∆x1, ∆x2, ∆x3, of the two endsof the interval furnish the same sum of squares,s2= ∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32,(1)for every orientation of the interval, then the space of refer-
ence is called Euclidean, and the co-ordinates Cartesian.∗It issufficient, indeed, to make this assumption in the limit for an
infinitely small interval. Involved in this assumption there are
some which are rather less special, to which we must call atten-
tion on account of their fundamental significance. In the first
place, it is assumed that one can move an ideal rigid body in an
arbitrary manner. In the second place, it is assumed that the be-
haviour of ideal rigid bodies towards orientation is independent∗This relation must hold for an arbitrary choice of the origin and of thedirection (ratios ∆x1: ∆x2: ∆x3) of the interval.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS5of the material of the bodies and their changes of position, in the
sense that if two intervals can once be brought into coincidence,
they can always and everywhere be brought into coincidence.
Both of these assumptions, which are of fundamental impor-
tance for geometry and especially for physical measurements,
naturally arise from experience; in the theory of general relativ-
ity their validity needs to be assumed only for bodies and spaces
of reference which are infinitely small compared to astronomical
dimensions.The quantitys we call the length of the interval. In orderthat this may be uniquely determined it is necessary to fix arbi-
trarily the length of a definite interval; for example, we can put
it equal to 1 (unit of length). Then the lengths of all other inter-
vals may be determined. If we make thexνlinearly dependentupon a parameterλ,xν=aν+λbν,we obtain a line which has all the properties of the straight
lines of the Euclidean geometry. In particular, it easily follows
that by laying offn times the interval s upon a straight line, aninterval of lengthn · s is obtained. A length, therefore, meansthe result of a measurement carried out along a straight line by
means of a unit measuring rod. It has a significance which is as
independent of the system of co-ordinates as that of a straight
line, as will appear in the sequel.We come now to a train of thought which plays an analogousrˆole in the theories of special and general relativity. We askthe question: besides the Cartesian co-ordinates which we have
used are there other equivalent co-ordinates? An interval has
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY6a physical meaning which is independent of the choice of co-
ordinates; and so has the spherical surface which we obtain as
the locus of the end points of all equal intervals that we lay off
from an arbitrary point of our space of reference. Ifxνas wellasx0ν(ν from 1 to 3) are Cartesian co-ordinates of our spaceof reference, then the spherical surface will be expressed in our
two systems of co-ordinates by the equationsX∆xν2= const.(2)X∆x0ν2= const.(2a)How must thex0νbe expressed in terms of thexνin order thatequations(2)and(2a)may be equivalent to each other? Re-garding thex0νexpressed as functions of thexν, we can write,by Taylor’s theorem, for small values of the ∆xν,∆x0ν=Xα∂x0ν∂xα∆xα+12Xα,β∂2x0ν∂xα∂xβ∆xα∆xβ. . . .If we substitute(2a)in this equation and compare with(1),we see that thex0νmust be linear functions of thexν. If wetherefore putx0ν=aν+Xαbναxα,(3)or∆x0ν=Xαbνα∆xα,(3a)
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS7then the equivalence of equations(2)and(2a)is expressed inthe formX∆x0ν2=λX∆xν2(λ independent of ∆xν).(2b)It therefore follows thatλ must be a constant. If we put λ = 1,(2b)and(3a)furnish the conditionsXνbναbνβ=δαβ,(4)in whichδαβ= 1, orδαβ= 0, according asα = β or α 6= β. Theconditions(4)are called the conditions of orthogonality, and thetransformations(3),(4), linear orthogonal transformations. Ifwe stipulate thats2=P ∆xν2shall be equal to the square ofthe length in every system of co-ordinates, and if we always mea-
sure with the same unit scale, thenλ must be equal to 1. There-fore the linear orthogonal transformations are the only ones by
means of which we can pass from one Cartesian system of co-
ordinates in our space of reference to another. We see that in
applying such transformations the equations of a straight line
become equations of a straight line. Reversing equations(3a)by multiplying both sides bybνβand summing for all theν’s,we obtainXνbνβ∆x0ν=Xν,αbναbνβ∆xα=Xαδαβ∆xα= ∆xβ.(5)The same coefficients,b, also determine the inverse substitutionof ∆xν. Geometrically,bναis the cosine of the angle betweenthex0νaxis and thexαaxis.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY8To sum up, we can say that in the Euclidean geometrythere are (in a given space of reference) preferred systems of
co-ordinates, the Cartesian systems, which transform into each
other by linear orthogonal transformations. The distances be-tween two points of our space of reference, measured by a mea-
suring rod, is expressed in such co-ordinates in a particularly
simple manner. The whole of geometry may be founded upon
this conception of distance. In the present treatment, geometry
is related to actual things (rigid bodies), and its theorems are
statements concerning the behaviour of these things, which may
prove to be true or false.One is ordinarily accustomed to study geometry divorcedfrom any relation between its concepts and experience. There
are advantages in isolating that which is purely logical and in-
dependent of what is, in principle, incomplete empiricism. This
is satisfactory to the pure mathematician. He is satisfied if he
can deduce his theorems from axioms correctly, that is, without
errors of logic. The question as to whether Euclidean geometry
is true or not does not concern him. But for our purpose it
is necessary to associate the fundamental concepts of geometry
with natural objects; without such an association geometry is
worthless for the physicist. The physicist is concerned with the
question as to whether the theorems of geometry are true or
not. That Euclidean geometry, from this point of view, affirms
something more than the mere deductions derived logically from
definitions may be seen from the following simple consideration.Betweenn points of space there aren(n − 1)2distances,sµν;between these and the 3n co-ordinates we have the relationssµν2=x1(µ)−x1(ν)2+x2(µ)−x2(ν)2+. . . .
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS9From thesen(n − 1)2equations the 3n co-ordinates may beeliminated, and from this elimination at leastn(n − 1)2− 3nequations in thesµνwill result.∗Since thesµνare measurablequantities, and by definition are independent of each other, these
relations between thesµνare not necessary a priori.From the foregoing it is evident that the equations of trans-formation(3),(4)have a fundamental significance in Euclideangeometry, in that they govern the transformation from one
Cartesian system of co-ordinates to another.The Cartesiansystems of co-ordinates are characterized by the property that
in them the measurable distance between two points,s, isexpressed by the equations2=X∆xν2.IfK(xν)andK0(xν)are two Cartesian systems of co-ordinates,thenX∆xν2=X∆x0ν2.The right-hand side is identically equal to the left-hand sideon account of the equations of the linear orthogonal transfor-
mation, and the right-hand side differs from the left-hand side
only in that thexνare replaced by thex0ν. This is expressedby the statement thatP ∆xν2is an invariant with respect tolinear orthogonal transformations. It is evident that in the Eu-
clidean geometry only such, and all such, quantities have an
objective significance, independent of the particular choice of∗In reality there aren(n − 1)2− 3n + 6 equations.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY10the Cartesian co-ordinates, as can be expressed by an invari-
ant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations. This is
the reason that the theory of invariants, which has to do with
the laws that govern the form of invariants, is so important for
analytical geometry.As a second example of a geometrical invariant, consider avolume. This is expressed byV =Z Z Zdx1dx2dx3.By means of Jacobi’s theorem we may writeZ Z Zdx01dx02dx03=Z Z Z∂(x01, x02, x03)∂(x1, x2, x3)dx1dx2dx3where the integrand in the last integral is the functional deter-
minant of thex0νwith respect to thexν, and this by(3)is equalto the determinant |bµν| of the coefficients of substitution,bνα. Ifwe form the determinant of theδµαfrom equation(4), we obtain,by means of the theorem of multiplication of determinants,1 = |δαβ| =



Xνbναbνβ



= |bµν|2;|bµν| = ±1.(6)If we limit ourselves to those transformations which have the de-
terminant +1,∗and only these arise from continuous variationsof the systems of co-ordinates, thenV is an invariant.∗There are thus two kinds of Cartesian systems which are designated as“right-handed” and “left-handed” systems. The difference between these is
familiar to every physicist and engineer. It is interesting to note that these
two kinds of systems cannot be defined geometrically, but only the contrast
between them.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS11Invariants, however, are not the only forms by means ofwhich we can give expression to the independence of the par-
ticular choice of the Cartesian co-ordinates. Vectors and tensors
are other forms of expression. Let us express the fact that the
point with the current co-ordinatesxνlies upon a straight line.We havexν−Aν=λBν(ν from 1 to 3).Without limiting the generality we can putX Bν2= 1.If we multiply the equations bybβν(compare(3a)and(5))and sum for all theν’s, we getx0β−A0β=λB0β,where we have writtenB0β=XνbβνBν;A0β=XνbβνAν.These are the equations of straight lines with respect to asecond Cartesian system of co-ordinatesK0.They have thesame form as the equations with respect to the original sys-
tem of co-ordinates. It is therefore evident that straight lines
have a significance which is independent of the system of co-
ordinates. Formally, this depends upon the fact that the quan-
tities (xν−Aν) −λBνare transformed as the components ofan interval, ∆xν. The ensemble of three quantities, defined forevery system of Cartesian co-ordinates, and which transform as
the components of an interval, is called a vector. If the three
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY12components of a vector vanish for one system of Cartesian co-
ordinates, they vanish for all systems, because the equations of
transformation are homogeneous. We can thus get the meaning
of the concept of a vector without referring to a geometrical rep-
resentation. This behaviour of the equations of a straight line
can be expressed by saying that the equation of a straight line
is co-variant with respect to linear orthogonal transformations.We shall now show briefly that there are geometrical entitieswhich lead to the concept of tensors. LetP0be the centre of asurface of the second degree,P any point on the surface, andξνthe projections of the intervalP0P upon the co-ordinate axes.Then the equation of the surface isX aµνξµξν= 1.In this, and in analogous cases, we shall omit the sign of sum-
mation, and understand that the summation is to be carried out
for those indices that appear twice. We thus write the equation
of the surfaceaµνξµξν= 1.The quantitiesaµνdetermine the surface completely, for a givenposition of the centre, with respect to the chosen system of
Cartesian co-ordinates. From the known law of transformation
for theξν(3a)for linear orthogonal transformations, we easilyfind the law of transformation for theaµν:∗a0στ=bσµbτ νaµν.∗The equation a0στξ0σξ0τ=1 may,by(5),be replaced bya0στbµσbντξµξν= 1, from which the result stated immediately follows.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS13This transformation is homogeneous and of the first degree in
theaµν. On account of this transformation, theaµνare calledcomponents of a tensor of the second rank (the latter on account
of the double index). If all the components,aµν, of a tensor withrespect to any system of Cartesian co-ordinates vanish, they
vanish with respect to every other Cartesian system. The form
and the position of the surface of the second degree is described
by this tensor (a).Analytic tensors of higher rank (number of indices) may bedefined. It is possible and advantageous to regard vectors as
tensors of rank 1, and invariants (scalars) as tensors of rank 0.
In this respect, the problem of the theory of invariants may be so
formulated: according to what laws may new tensors be formed
from given tensors? We shall consider these laws now, in order
to be able to apply them later. We shall deal first only with the
properties of tensors with respect to the transformation from
one Cartesian system to another in the same space of reference,
by means of linear orthogonal transformations. As the laws are
wholly independent of the number of dimensions, we shall leave
this number,n, indefinite at first.Definition.If a figure is defined with respect to every sys-tem of Cartesian co-ordinates in a space of reference ofn dimen-sions by thenαnumbersAµνρ· · ·(α = number of indices), thenthese numbers are the components of a tensor of rankα if thetransformation law isA0µ0ν0ρ0· · ·=bµ0µbν0νbρ0ρ. . . Aµνρ· · ·.(7)
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY14Remark.From this definition it follows thatAµνρ· · ·=BµCνDρ. . .(8)is an invariant, provided that (B), (C), (D) . . . are vectors.Conversely, the tensor character of (A) may be inferred, if itis known that the expression(8)leads to an invariant for anarbitrary choice of the vectors (B), (C), etc.Addition and Subtraction.By addition and subtraction ofthe corresponding components of tensors of the same rank, a
tensor of equal rank results:Aµνρ· · ·±Bµνρ· · ·=Cµνρ· · ·.(9)The proof follows from the definition of a tensor given above.Multiplication.From a tensor of rankα and a tensor ofrankβ we may obtain a tensor of rank α + β by multiplying allthe components of the first tensor by all the components of the
second tensor:Tµνρ· · ·αβ· · ·=Aµνρ· · ·Bαβγ· · ·.(10)Contraction.A tensor of rankα − 2 may be obtained fromone of rankα by putting two definite indices equal to each otherand then summing for this single index:Tρ· · ·=Aµµρ· · ·(=XµAµµρ· · ·).(11)
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS15The proof isA0µµρ· · ·=bµαbµβbργ. . . Aαβγ· · ·=δαβbργ. . . Aαβγ· · ·=bργ. . . Aααγ· · ·.In addition to these elementary rules of operation there isalso the formation of tensors by differentiation (“erweiterung”):Tµνρ· · ·α=∂Aµνρ· · ·∂xα.(12)New tensors, in respect to linear orthogonal transformations,may be formed from tensors according to these rules of opera-
tion.Symmetrical Properties of Tensors.Tensors are called sym-metrical or skew-symmetrical in respect to two of their indices,
µ and ν, if both the components which result from interchang-
ing the indicesµ and ν are equal to each other or equal withopposite signs.Condition for symmetry:Aµνρ=Aνµρ.Condition for skew-symmetry:Aµνρ= −Aνµρ.Theorem.The character of symmetry or skew-symmetryexists independently of the choice of co-ordinates, and in this
lies its importance. The proof follows from the equation defin-
ing tensors.Special Tensors.
I. The quantitiesδρσ(4)are tensor components (fundamen-tal tensor).
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY16Proof.If in the right-hand side of the equation of trans-formationA0µν=bµαbνβAαβ, we substitute forAαβthe quanti-tiesδαβ(which are equal to 1 or 0 according asα = β or α 6= β),we getA0µν=bµαbνα=δµν.The justification for the last sign of equality becomes evident if
one applies(4)to the inverse substitution(5).II. There is a tensor (δµνρ· · ·) skew-symmetrical with respectto all pairs of indices, whose rank is equal to the number of
dimensions,n, and whose components are equal to +1 or −1according asµ ν ρ . . . is an even or odd permutation of 1 2 3 . . . .The proof follows with the aid of the theorem proved above|bρσ| = 1.These few simple theorems form the apparatus from thetheory of invariants for building the equations of pre-relativity
physics and the theory of special relativity.We have seen that in pre-relativity physics, in order to spec-ify relations in space, a body of reference, or a space of reference,
is required, and, in addition, a Cartesian system of co-ordinates.
We can fuse both these concepts into a single one by thinking
of a Cartesian system of co-ordinates as a cubical frame-work
formed of rods each of unit length. The co-ordinates of the lat-
tice points of this frame are integral numbers. It follows from
the fundamental relations2= ∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32(13)that the members of such a space-lattice are all of unit length.
To specify relations in time, we require in addition a standard
clock placed at the origin of our Cartesian system of co-ordinates
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS17or frame of reference. If an event takes place anywhere we can
assign to it three co-ordinates,xν, and a timet, as soon aswe have specified the time of the clock at the origin which is
simultaneous with the event. We therefore give an objective sig-
nificance to the statement of the simultaneity of distant events,
while previously we have been concerned only with the simul-
taneity of two experiences of an individual. The time so specified
is at all events independent of the position of the system of co-
ordinates in our space of reference, and is therefore an invariant
with respect to the transformation(3).It is postulated that the system of equations expressing thelaws of pre-relativity physics is co-variant with respect to the
transformation(3), as are the relations of Euclidean geometry.The isotropy and homogeneity of space is expressed in this way.∗We shall now consider some of the more important equations of
physics from this point of view.The equations of motion of a material particle aremd2xνdt2=Xν;(14)(dxν) is a vector;dt, and therefore also1dt, an invariant; thus∗The laws of physics could be expressed, even in case there were aunique direction in space, in such a way as to be co-variant with respect
to the transformation(3); but such an expression would in this case beunsuitable. If there were a unique direction in space it would simplify the
description of natural phenomena to orient the system of co-ordinates in
a definite way in this direction. But if, on the other hand, there is no
unique direction in space it is not logical to formulate the laws of nature
in such a way as to conceal the equivalence of systems of co-ordinates that
are oriented differently. We shall meet with this point of view again in the
theories of special and general relativity.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY18dxνdtis a vector; in the same way it may be shown thatd2xνdt2is a vector. In general, the operation of differentiationwith respect to time does not alter the tensor character. Sincem is an invariant (tensor of rank 0),md2xνdt2is a vector, ortensor of rank 1 (by the theorem of the multiplication of ten-
sors). If the force (Xν) has a vector character, the same holds forthe differencemd2xνdt2−Xν. These equations of motion aretherefore valid in every other system of Cartesian co-ordinates
in the space of reference. In the case where the forces are con-
servative we can easily recognize the vector character of (Xν).For a potential energy, Φ, exists, which depends only upon the
mutual distances of the particles, and is therefore an invariant.The vector character of the force,Xν= −∂Φ∂xν, is then a conse-quence of our general theorem about the derivative of a tensor
of rank 0.Multiplying by the velocity, a tensor of rank 1, we obtain thetensor equationmd2xνdt2−Xνdxνdt= 0.By contraction and multiplication by the scalardt we obtain theequation of kinetic energydmq22=Xνdxν.
PRE-RELATIVITY PHYSICS19Ifξνdenotes the difference of the co-ordinates of the ma-terial particle and a point fixed in space, then theξνhave thecharacter of vectors. We evidently haved2xνdt2=d2ξνdt2, so thatthe equations of motion of the particle may be writtenmd2ξνdt2−Xν= 0.Multiplying this equation byξµwe obtain a tensor equationmd2ξνdt2−Xνξµ= 0.Contracting the tensor on the left and taking the time av-erage we obtain the virial theorem, which we shall not consider
further. By interchanging the indices and subsequent subtrac-
tion, we obtain, after a simple transformation, the theorem of
moments,ddtmξµdξνdt−ξνdξµdt=ξµXν−ξνXµ.(15)It is evident in this way that the moment of a vector is not avector but a tensor. On account of their skew-symmetrical char-
acter there are not nine, but only three independent equations of
this system. The possibility of replacing skew-symmetrical ten-
sors of the second rank in space of three dimensions by vectors
depends upon the formation of the vectorAµ=12Aστδστ µ.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY20If we multiply the skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2 by thespecial skew-symmetrical tensorδ introduced above, and con-tract twice, a vector results whose components are numerically
equal to those of the tensor. These are the so-called axial vec-
tors which transform differently, from a right-handed system to
a left-handed system, from the ∆xν. There is a gain in pic-turesqueness in regarding a skew-symmetrical tensor of rank 2
as a vector in space of three dimensions, but it does not repre-
sent the exact nature of the corresponding quantity so well as
considering it a tensor.We consider next the equations of motion of a continuousmedium. Letρ be the density, uνthe velocity components con-sidered as functions of the co-ordinates and the time,Xνthevolume forces per unit of mass, andpνσthe stresses upon a sur-face perpendicular to theσ-axis in the direction of increasing xν.Then the equations of motion are, by Newton’s law,ρduνdt= −∂pνσ∂xσ+ρXν,in whichduνdtis the acceleration of the particle which at timethas the co-ordinatesxν. If we express this acceleration by partialdifferential coefficients, we obtain, after dividing byρ,∂uνdt+∂uνdxσuσ= −1
ρ∂pνσ∂xσ+Xν.(16)We must show that this equation holds independently of thespecial choice of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates. (uν) is avector, and therefore∂uν∂tis also a vector.∂uν∂xσis a tensor of

finitely small tetrahedron. It is also proved there, by applica-
tion of the theorem of moments to an infinitely small parallelop-
ipedon, thatpνσ=pσν, and hence that the tensor of the stress isa symmetrical tensor. From what has been said it follows that,
with the aid of the rules given above, the equation is co-variant
with respect to orthogonal transformations in space (rotational
transformations); and the rules according to which the quan-
tities in the equation must be transformed in order that the
equation may be co-variant also become evident.The co-variance of the equation of continuity,∂ρ∂t+∂(ρuν)∂xν= 0,(17)requires, from the foregoing, no particular discussion.We shall also test for co-variance the equations which expressthe dependence of the stress components upon the properties of

ible viscous fluid with the aid of the conditions of co-variance.
If we neglect the viscosity, the pressure,p, will be a scalar, andwill depend only upon the density and the temperature of the
fluid. The contribution to the stress tensor is then evidentlypδµνin whichδµνis the special symmetrical tensor. This term willalso be present in the case of a viscous fluid. But in this case
there will also be pressure terms, which depend upon the space
derivatives of theuν. We shall assume that this dependence is alinear one. Since these terms must be symmetrical tensors, the

interpretation of the field) will then offer fewer difficulties.
LECTURE IITHE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITYTheprevious considerations concerning the configuration ofrigid bodies have been founded, irrespective of the assumption
as to the validity of the Euclidean geometry, upon the hypothesis
that all directions in space, or all configurations of Cartesian sys-
tems of co-ordinates, are physically equivalent. We may express
this as the “principle of relativity with respect to direction,” and
it has been shown how equations (laws of nature) may be found,
in accord with this principle, by the aid of the calculus of ten-
sors. We now inquire whether there is a relativity with respect
to the state of motion of the space of reference; in other words,
whether there are spaces of reference in motion relatively to each
other which are physically equivalent. From the standpoint of
mechanics it appears that equivalent spaces of reference do ex-
ist. For experiments upon the earth tell us nothing of the fact
that we are moving about the sun with a velocity of approxi-
mately 30 kilometres a second. On the other hand, this physical
equivalence does not seem to hold for spaces of reference in ar-
bitrary motion; for mechanical effects do not seem to be subject
to the same laws in a jolting railway train as in one moving with
uniform velocity; the rotation of the earth must be considered
in writing down the equations of motion relatively to the earth.
It appears, therefore, as if there were Cartesian systems of co-
ordinates, the so-called inertial systems, with reference to which
the laws of mechanics (more generally the laws of physics) are
expressed in the simplest form. We may infer the validity of
the following theorem: IfK is an inertial system, then every25
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY26other systemK0which moves uniformly and without rotationrelatively toK, is also an inertial system; the laws of nature arein concordance for all inertial systems. This statement we shall
call the “principle of special relativity.” We shall draw certain
conclusions from this principle of “relativity of translation” just
as we have already done for relativity of direction.In order to be able to do this, we must first solve the followingproblem. If we are given the Cartesian co-ordinates,xν, andthe time,t, of an event relatively to one inertial system, K,how can we calculate the co-ordinates,x0ν, and the time,t0, ofthe same event relatively to an inertial systemK0which moveswith uniform translation relatively toK? In the pre-relativityphysics this problem was solved by making unconsciously two
hypotheses:—1. The time is absolute; the time of an event,t0, relativelytoK0is the same as the time relatively toK. If instantaneoussignals could be sent to a distance, and if one knew that the
state of motion of a clock had no influence on its rate, then this
assumption would be physically established. For then clocks,
similar to one another, and regulated alike, could be distributed
over the systemsK and K0, at rest relatively to them, and theirindications would be independent of the state of motion of the
systems; the time of an event would then be given by the clock
in its immediate neighbourhood.2. Length is absolute; if an interval, at rest relatively toK,has a lengths, then it has the same length s relatively to asystemK0which is in motion relatively toK.If the axes ofK and K0are parallel to each other, a simplecalculation based on these two assumptions, gives the equations
SPECIAL RELATIVITY27of transformationx0ν=xν−aν−bνt,t0=t − b.)(21)This transformation is known as the “Galilean Transforma-tion.” Differentiating twice by the time, we getd2x0νdt2=d2xνdt2.Further, it follows that for two simultaneous events,x0ν(1)−x0ν(2)=xν(1)−xν(2).The invariance of the distance between the two points results
from squaring and adding.From this easily follows the co-variance of Newton’s equations of motion with respect to the
Galilean transformation(21).Hence it follows that classicalmechanics is in accord with the principle of special relativity if
the two hypotheses respecting scales and clocks are made.But this attempt to found relativity of translation upon theGalilean transformation fails when applied to electromagnetic
phenomena.The Maxwell-Lorentz electromagnetic equationsare not co-variant with respect to the Galilean transformation.
In particular, we note, by(21), that a ray of light which referredtoK has a velocity c, has a different velocity referred to K0,depending upon its direction. The space of reference ofK istherefore distinguished, with respect to its physical properties,
from all spaces of reference which are in motion relatively to it
(quiescent æther). But all experiments have shown that electro-
magnetic and optical phenomena, relatively to the earth as the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY28body of reference, are not influenced by the translational veloc-
ity of the earth. The most important of these experiments are
those of Michelson and Morley, which I shall assume are known.
The validity of the principle of special relativity can therefore
hardly be doubted.On the other hand, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations haveproved their validity in the treatment of optical problems in
moving bodies. No other theory has satisfactorily explained the
facts of aberration, the propagation of light in moving bodies
(Fizeau), and phenomena observed in double stars (De Sitter).
The consequence of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations that in a
vacuum light is propagated with the velocityc, at least with re-spect to a definite inertial systemK, must therefore be regardedas proved. According to the principle of special relativity, we
must also assume the truth of this principle for every other
inertial system.Before we draw any conclusions from these two principleswe must first review the physical significance of the concepts
“time” and “velocity.” It follows from what has gone before, that
co-ordinates with respect to an inertial system are physically
defined by means of measurements and constructions with the
aid of rigid bodies. In order to measure time, we have supposed
a clock,U, present somewhere, at rest relatively to K. Butwe cannot fix the time, by means of this clock, of an event
whose distance from the clock is not negligible; for there are no
“instantaneous signals” that we can use in order to compare the
time of the event with that of the clock. In order to complete the
definition of time we may employ the principle of the constancy
of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Let us suppose that we
place similar clocks at points of the systemK, at rest relatively
SPECIAL RELATIVITY29to it, and regulated according to the following scheme. A ray
of light is sent out from one of the clocks,Um, at the instantwhen it indicates the timetm, and travels through a vacuum adistancermn, to the clockUn; at the instant when this ray meetsthe clockUnthe latter is set to indicate the timetn=tm+rmnc.∗The principle of the constancy of the velocity of light then states
that this adjustment of the clocks will not lead to contradictions.
With clocks so adjusted, we can assign the time to events which
take place near any one of them. It is essential to note that this
definition of time relates only to the inertial systemK, sincewe have used a system of clocks at rest relatively toK. Theassumption which was made in the pre-relativity physics of the
absolute character of time (i.e. the independence of time of the
choice of the inertial system) does not follow at all from this
definition.The theory of relativity is often criticized for giving, with-out justification, a central theoretical rˆole to the propagationof light, in that it founds the concept of time upon the law of
propagation of light. The situation, however, is somewhat as
follows. In order to give physical significance to the concept of
time, processes of some kind are required which enable relations
to be established between different places. It is immaterial what
kind of processes one chooses for such a definition of time. It
is advantageous, however, for the theory, to choose only those∗Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to define simultaneity first,somewhat as follows: two events taking place at the points A and B of
the system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when
observed from the middle point, M , of the interval AB.Time is thendefined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relatively
to K, which register the same simultaneously.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY30processes concerning which we know something certain. This
holds for the propagation of light in vacuo in a higher degree
than for any other process which could be considered, thanks to
the investigations of Maxwell and H. A. Lorentz.From all of these considerations, space and time data havea physically real, and not a mere fictitious, significance; in par-
ticular this holds for all the relations in which co-ordinates and
time enter, e.g. the relations(21). There is, therefore, sense inasking whether those equations are true or not, as well as in
asking what the true equations of transformation are by which
we pass from one inertial systemK to another, K0, moving rel-atively to it. It may be shown that this is uniquely settled by
means of the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light
and the principle of special relativity.To this end we think of space and time physically definedwith respect to two inertial systems,K and K0, in the way thathas been shown. Further, let a ray of light pass from one pointP1to another pointP2ofK through a vacuum. If r is the measureddistance between the two points, then the propagation of light
must satisfy the equationr = c · ∆t.If we square this equation, and expressr2by the differencesof the co-ordinates, ∆xν, in place of this equation we can writeX(∆xν)2−c2∆t2= 0.(22)This equation formulates the principle of the constancy of the
velocity of light relatively toK. It must hold whatever may bethe motion of the source which emits the ray of light.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY31The same propagation of light may also be considered rela-tively toK0, in which case also the principle of the constancy ofthe velocity of light must be satisfied. Therefore, with respect
toK0, we have the equationX(∆x0ν)2−c2∆t02= 0.(22a)Equations(22a)and(22)must be mutually consistent witheach other with respect to the transformation which transforms
fromK to K0. A transformation which effects this we shall calla “Lorentz transformation.”Before considering these transformations in detail we shallmake a few general remarks about space and time. In the pre-
relativity physics space and time were separate entities. Speci-
fications of time were independent of the choice of the space of
reference. The Newtonian mechanics was relative with respect
to the space of reference, so that, e.g. the statement that two
non-simultaneous events happened at the same place had no ob-
jective meaning (that is, independent of the space of reference).
But this relativity had no rˆole in building up the theory. Onespoke of points of space, as of instants of time, as if they were
absolute realities. It was not observed that the true element
of the space-time specification was the event, specified by the
four numbersx1,x2,x3,t. The conception of something hap-pening was always that of a four-dimensional continuum; but
the recognition of this was obscured by the absolute character
of the pre-relativity time. Upon giving up the hypothesis of the
absolute character of time, particularly that of simultaneity, the
four-dimensionality of the time-space concept was immediately
recognized. It is neither the point in space, nor the instant in
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY32time, at which something happens that has physical reality, but
only the event itself. There is no absolute (independent of the
space of reference) relation in space, and no absolute relation
in time between two events, but there is an absolute (indepen-
dent of the space of reference) relation in space and time, as
will appear in the sequel. The circumstance that there is no
objective rational division of the four-dimensional continuum
into a three-dimensional space and a one-dimensional time con-
tinuum indicates that the laws of nature will assume a form
which is logically most satisfactory when expressed as laws in
the four-dimensional space-time continuum. Upon this depends
the great advance in method which the theory of relativity owes
to Minkowski. Considered from this standpoint, we must regard
x1,x2,x3,t as the four co-ordinates of an event in the four-dimensional continuum. We have far less success in picturing
to ourselves relations in this four-dimensional continuum than
in the three-dimensional Euclidean continuum; but it must be
emphasized that even in the Euclidean three-dimensional geom-
etry its concepts and relations are only of an abstract nature in
our minds, and are not at all identical with the images we form
visually and through our sense of touch. The non-divisibility of
the four-dimensional continuum of events does not at all, how-
ever, involve the equivalence of the space co-ordinates with the
time co-ordinate. On the contrary, we must remember that the
time co-ordinate is defined physically wholly differently from the
space co-ordinates. The relations(22)and(22a)which whenequated define the Lorentz transformation show, further, a dif-
ference in the rˆole of the time co-ordinate from that of the spaceco-ordinates; for the term ∆t2has the opposite sign to the spaceterms, ∆x12, ∆x22, ∆x32.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY33Before we analyse further the conditions which define theLorentz transformation, we shall introduce the light-time,l = ct,in place of the time,t, in order that the constant c shall notenter explicitly into the formulas to be developed later. Then
the Lorentz transformation is defined in such a way that, first,
it makes the equation∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32− ∆l2= 0(22b)a co-variant equation, that is, an equation which is satisfied with
respect to every inertial system if it is satisfied in the inertial
system to which we refer the two given events (emission and
reception of the ray of light). Finally, with Minkowski, we intro-
duce in place of the real time co-ordinatel = ct, the imaginarytime co-ordinatex4=il = ict (√−1 =i).Then the equation defining the propagation of light, which must
be co-variant with respect to the Lorentz transformation, be-
comesX(4)∆xν2= ∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32+ ∆x42= 0.(22c)This condition is always satisfied∗if we satisfy the more generalcondition thats2= ∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32+ ∆x42(23)∗That this specialization lies in the nature of the case will be evidentlater.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY34shall be an invariant with respect to the transformation. This
condition is satisfied only by linear transformations, that is,
transformations of the typex0µ=aµ+bµαxα(24)in which the summation over theα is to be extended from α = 1toα = 4. A glance at equations(23)and(24)shows that theLorentz transformation so defined is identical with the transla-
tional and rotational transformations of the Euclidean geometry,
if we disregard the number of dimensions and the relations of re-
ality. We can also conclude that the coefficientsbµαmust satisfythe conditionsbµαbνα=δµν=bαµbαν.(25)Since the ratios of thexνare real, it follows that all theaµandthebµαare real, excepta4,b41,b42,b43,b14,b24andb34, whichare purely imaginary.Special Lorentz Transformation.We obtain the simplesttransformations of the type of(24)and(25)if only two of theco-ordinates are to be transformed, and if all theaµ, which de-termine the new origin, vanish. We obtain then for the indices
1 and 2, on account of the three independent conditions which
the relations(25)furnish,x01=x1cosφ − x2sinφ,x02=x1sinφ + x2cosφ,x03=x3,x04=x4.(26)
SPECIAL RELATIVITY35This is a simple rotation in space of the (space) co-ordinatesystem aboutx3-axis. We see that the rotational transformationin space (without the time transformation) which we studied
before is contained in the Lorentz transformation as a special
case. For the indices 1 and 4 we obtain, in an analogous manner,x01=x1cosψ − x4sinψ,x04=x1sinψ + x4cosψ,x02=x2,x03=x3.(26a)On account of the relations of realityψ must be taken asimaginary. To interpret these equations physically, we introduce
the real light-timel and the velocity v of K0relatively toK,instead of the imaginary angleψ. We have, first,x01=x1cosψ − il sin ψ,l0= −ix1sinψ + l cos ψ.Since for the origin ofK0i.e., forx1= 0, we must havex1=vl,it follows from the first of these equations thatv = i tan ψ,(27)and alsosinψ =−iv√1 −v2,cosψ =1√1 −v2,(28)

through an imaginary angle, of the four-dimensional system of
co-ordinates. If we introduce the ordinary timet, in place of thelight-timel, then in(29)we must replacel by ct and v byvc.We must now fill in a gap. From the principle of the con-stancy of the velocity of light it follows that the equationX∆xν2= 0has a significance which is independent of the choice of the in-
ertial system; but the invariance of the quantityP ∆xν2doesnot at all follow from this. This quantity might be transformed
with a factor. This depends upon the fact that the right-hand
side of(29)might be multiplied by a factorλ, independent of v.But the principle of relativity does not permit this factor to be
different from 1, as we shall now show. Let us assume that we
have a rigid circular cylinder moving in the direction of its axis.
If its radius, measured at rest with a unit measuring rod is equal
toR0, its radiusR in motion, might be different from R0, sincethe theory of relativity does not make the assumption that the
shape of bodies with respect to a space of reference is indepen-
dent of their motion relatively to this space of reference. But
SPECIAL RELATIVITY37all directions in space must be equivalent to each other.R maytherefore depend upon the magnitudeq of the velocity, but notupon its direction;R must therefore be an even function of q. Ifthe cylinder is at rest relatively toK0the equation of its lateralsurface isx02+y02=R02.If we write the last two equations of(29)more generallyx02=λx2,x03=λx3,then the lateral surface of the cylinder referred toK satisfies theequationx2+y2=R02λ2.The factorλ therefore measures the lateral contraction of thecylinder, and can thus, from the above, be only an even function
ofv.If we introduce a third system of co-ordinates,K00, whichmoves relatively toK0with velocityv in the direction of thenegativex-axis of K, we obtain, by applying(29)twice,x001=λ(v)λ(−v)x1,x002=λ(v)λ(−v)x2,x003=λ(v)λ(−v)x3,l00=λ(v)λ(−v)l.Now, sinceλ(v) must be equal to λ(−v), and since we assumethat we use the same measuring rods in all the systems, it fol-
lows that the transformation ofK00toK must be the identical
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY38transformation (since the possibilityλ = −1 does not need tobe considered). It is essential for these considerations to assume
that the behaviour of the measuring rods does not depend upon
the history of their previous motion.Moving Measuring Rods and Clocks.At the definiteK-time,l = 0, the position of the points given by the integersx01=n, is with respect to K, given by x1=n√1 −v2; this fol-lows from the first of equations(29)and expresses the Lorentzcontraction. A clock at rest at the originx1= 0 ofK, whosebeats are characterized byl = n, will, when observed from K0,have beats characterized byl0=n√1 −v2;this follows from the second of equations(29)and shows thatthe clock goes slower than if it were at rest relatively toK0.These two consequences, which hold, mutatis mutandis, for ev-
ery system of reference, form the physical content, free from
convention, of the Lorentz transformation.Addition Theorem for Velocities.If we combine two specialLorentz transformations with the relative velocitiesv1andv2,then the velocity of the single Lorentz transformation which
takes the place of the two separate ones is, according to(27),given byv12=i tan(ψ1+ψ2) =itanψ1+ tanψ21 − tanψ1tanψ2=v1+v21 +v1v2.(30)
SPECIAL RELATIVITY39General Statements about the Lorentz Transformation andits Theory of Invariants.The whole theory of invariants of thespecial theory of relativity depends upon the invariants2(23).Formally, it has the same rˆole in the four-dimensional space-timecontinuum as the invariant ∆x12+∆x22+∆x32in the Euclideangeometry and in the pre-relativity physics. The latter quantity
is not an invariant with respect to all the Lorentz transforma-
tions; the quantitys2of equation(23)assumes the rˆole of thisinvariant. With respect to an arbitrary inertial system,s2maybe determined by measurements; with a given unit of measure
it is a completely determinate quantity, associated with an ar-
bitrary pair of events.The invariants2differs, disregarding the number of dimen-sions, from the corresponding invariant of the Euclidean geom-
etry in the following points. In the Euclidean geometrys2isnecessarily positive; it vanishes only when the two points con-
cerned come together. On the other hand, from the vanishing
ofs2=X(4)∆xν2= ∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32− ∆t2it cannot be concluded that the two space-time points fall to-
gether; the vanishing of this quantitys2, is the invariant condi-tion that the two space-time points can be connected by a light
signal in vacuo. IfP is a point (event) represented in the four-dimensional space of thex1,x2,x3,l, then all the “points” whichcan be connected toP by means of a light signal lie upon thecones2= 0 (compareFig. 1, in which the dimensionx3is sup-pressed). The “upper” half of the cone may contain the “points”
to which light signals can be sent fromP ; then the “lower” half
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY40x1x2lFig. 1.of the cone will contain the “points” from which light signals
can be sent toP . The points P0enclosed by the conical surfacefurnish, withP , a negative s2;P P0, as well asP0P is then, ac-cording to Minkowski, of the nature of a time. Such intervals
represent elements of possible paths of motion, the velocity be-
ing less than that of light.∗In this case thel-axis may be drawn∗That material velocities exceeding that of light are not possible, fol-lows from the appearance of the radical√1 − v2in the special Lorentz
SPECIAL RELATIVITY41in the direction ofP P0by suitably choosing the state of motionof the inertial system. IfP0lies outside of the “light-cone” thenP P0is of the nature of a space; in this case, by properly choosingthe inertial system, ∆l can be made to vanish.By the introduction of the imaginary time variable,x4=il, Minkowski has made the theory of invariants for the four-
dimensional continuum of physical phenomena fully analogous
to the theory of invariants for the three-dimensional continuum
of Euclidean space. The theory of four-dimensional tensors of
special relativity differs from the theory of tensors in three-
dimensional space, therefore, only in the number of dimensions
and the relations of reality.A physical entity which is specified by four quantities,Aν,in an arbitrary inertial system of thex1,x2,x3,x4, is calleda 4-vector, with the componentsAν, if theAνcorrespond intheir relations of reality and the properties of transformation to
the ∆xν; it may be of the nature of a space or of a time. Thesixteen quantitiesAµνthen form the components of a tensor ofthe second rank, if they transform according to the schemeA0µν=bµαbνβAαβ.It follows from this that theAµνbehave, with respect totheir properties of transformation and their properties of re-
ality, as the products of components,UµVν, of two 4-vectors,(U) and (V ). All the components are real except those whichcontain the index 4 once, those being purely imaginary. Tensors
of the third and higher ranks may be defined in an analogous
way. The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,transformation(29).
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY42contraction and differentiation for these tensors are wholly
analogous to the corresponding operations for tensors in three-
dimensional space.Before we apply the tensor theory to the four-dimensionalspace-time continuum, we shall examine more particularly the
skew-symmetrical tensors. The tensor of the second rank has, in
general, 16 = 4·4 components. In the case of skew-symmetry the
components with two equal indices vanish, and the components
with unequal indices are equal and opposite in pairs. There
exist, therefore, only six independent components, as is the case
in the electromagnetic field. In fact, it will be shown when we
consider Maxwell’s equations that these may be looked upon as
tensor equations, provided we regard the electromagnetic field
as a skew-symmetrical tensor. Further, it is clear that the skew-
symmetrical tensor of the third rank (skew-symmetrical in all
pairs of indices) has only four independent components, since
there are only four combinations of three different indices.We now turn to Maxwell’s equations(19a),(19b),(20a),(20b), and introduce the notation:∗φ23φ31φ12φ14φ24φ34h23h31h12−iex−iey−iez)(30a)J1J2J3J41cix1ciy1ciziρ(31)with the convention thatφµνshall be equal to −φνµ.Then∗In order to avoid confusion from now on we shall use the three-dimensional space indices, x, y, z instead of 1, 2, 3, and we shall reserve the
numeral indices 1, 2, 3, 4 for the four-dimensional space-time continuum.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY43Maxwell’s equations may be combined into the forms∂φµν∂xν=Jµ,(32)∂φµν∂xσ+∂φνσ∂xµ+∂φσµ∂xν= 0,(33)as one can easily verify by substituting from(30a)and(31).Equations(32)and(33)have a tensor character, and aretherefore co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations,
if theφµνand theJνhave a tensor character, which we assume.Consequently, the laws for transforming these quantities from
one to another allowable (inertial) system of co-ordinates are
uniquely determined. The progress in method which electro-
dynamics owes to the theory of special relativity lies principally
in this, that the number of independent hypotheses is dimin-
ished. If we consider, for example, equations(19a)only from thestandpoint of relativity of direction, as we have done above, we
see that they have three logically independent terms. The way
in which the electric intensity enters these equations appears to
be wholly independent of the way in which the magnetic inten-sity enters them; it would not be surprising if instead of∂eµ∂l,we had, say,∂2eµ∂l2, or if this term were absent. On the otherhand, only two independent terms appear in equation(32). Theelectromagnetic field appears as a formal unit; the way in which
the electric field enters this equation is determined by the way in
which the magnetic field enters it. Besides the electromagnetic
field, only the electric current density appears as an independent
entity. This advance in method arises from the fact that the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY44electric and magnetic fields draw their separate existences from
the relativity of motion. A field which appears to be purely an
electric field, judged from one system, has also magnetic field
components when judged from another inertial system. When
applied to an electromagnetic field, the general law of trans-
formation furnishes, for the special case of the special Lorentz
transformation, the equationse0x= exh0x= hx,e0y=ey−vhz√1 −v2h0y=hy+vez√1 −v2,e0z=ez+vhy√1 −v2h0z=hz−vey√1 −v2.(34)If there exists with respect toK only a magnetic field, h, butno electric field, e, then with respect toK0there exists an electricfield e0as well, which would act upon an electric particle at restrelatively toK0. An observer at rest relatively toK would des-ignate this force as the Biot-Savart force, or the Lorentz electro-
motive force. It therefore appears as if this electromotive force
had become fused with the electric field intensity into a single
entity.In order to view this relation formally, let us consider theexpression for the force acting upon unit volume of electricity,k =ρe + [i, h],(35)in which i is the vector velocity of electricity, with the velocity
of light as the unit. If we introduceJµandφµνaccording to(30a)and(31), we obtain for the first component the expressionφ12J2+φ13J3+φ14J4.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY45Observing thatφ11vanishes on account of the skew-symmetry ofthe tensor (φ), the components of k are given by the first threecomponents of the four-dimensional vectorKµ=φµνJν,(36)and the fourth component is given byK4=φ41J1+φ42J2+φ43J3=i(exix+ eyiy+ eziz) =iλ. (37)There is, therefore, a four-dimensional vector of force per unit
volume, whose first three components,K1,K2,K3, are the pon-deromotive force components per unit volume, and whose fourth
component is the rate of working of the field per unit volume,
multiplied by√−1.A comparison of(36)and(35)shows that the theory of rel-ativity formally unites the ponderomotive force of the electric
field,ρe, and the Biot-Savart or Lorentz force [i, h].Mass and Energy.An important conclusion can be drawnfrom the existence and significance of the 4-vectorKµ. Let usimagine a body upon which the electromagnetic field acts for
a time. In the symbolic figure (Fig. 2)Ox1designates thex1-axis, and is at the same time a substitute for the three space axes
Ox1,Ox2,Ox3;Ol designates the real time axis. In this diagrama body of finite extent is represented, at a definite timel, bythe intervalAB; the whole space-time existence of the body isrepresented by a strip whose boundary is everywhere inclined
less than 45◦to thel-axis. Between the time sections, l = l1andl = l2, but not extending to them, a portion of the strip isshaded. This represents the portion of the space-time manifold
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY46x1ll1ll2OABFig. 2.in which the electromagnetic field acts upon the body, or upon
the electric charges contained in it, the action upon them being
transmitted to the body. We shall now consider the changes
which take place in the momentum and energy of the body as a
result of this action.We shall assume that the principles of momentum andenergy are valid for the body.The change in momentum,∆Ix, ∆Iy, ∆Iz, and the change in energy, ∆E, are then given
SPECIAL RELATIVITY47by the expressions∆Ix=Zl2l1dlZkxdx dy dz =1iZK1dx1dx2dx3dx4,∆Iy=Zl2l1dlZkydx dy dz =1iZK2dx1dx2dx3dx4,∆Iz=Zl2l1dlZkzdx dy dz =1iZK3dx1dx2dx3dx4,∆E =Zl2l1dlZλ dx dy dz =1iZ1iK4dx1dx2dx3dx4.Since the four-dimensional element of volume is an invariant,
and (K1, K2, K3, K4) forms a 4-vector, the four-dimensional in-tegral extended over the shaded portion transforms as a 4-vector,
as does also the integral between the limitsl1andl2, becausethe portion of the region which is not shaded contributes nothing
to the integral. It follows, therefore, that ∆Ix, ∆Iy, ∆Iz,i∆Eform a 4-vector. Since the quantities themselves transform in
the same way as their increments, it follows that the aggregate
of the four quantitiesIx, Iy, Iz, iEhas itself the properties of a vector; these quantities are referred
to an instantaneous condition of the body (e.g. at the timel =l1).This 4-vector may also be expressed in terms of the massm,and the velocity of the body, considered as a material particle.
To form this expression, we note first, that−ds2=dτ2= −(dx12+dx22+dx32) −dx42=dl2(1 −q2) (38)
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY48is an invariant which refers to an infinitely short portion of the
four-dimensional line which represents the motion of the mate-
rial particle. The physical significance of the invariantdτ mayeasily be given. If the time axis is chosen in such a way that it
has the direction of the line differential which we are consider-
ing, or, in other words, if we reduce the material particle to rest,
we shall then havedτ = dl; this will therefore be measured bythe light-seconds clock which is at the same place, and at rest
relatively to the material particle. We therefore callτ the propertime of the material particle. As opposed todl, dτ is therefore aninvariant, and is practically equivalent todl for motions whosevelocity is small compared to that of light. Hence we see thatuσ=dxσdτ(39)has, just as thedxν, the character of a vector; we shall desig-nate (uσ) as the four-dimensional vector (in brief, 4-vector) ofvelocity. Its components satisfy, by(38), the conditionX uσ2= −1.(40)We see that this 4-vector, whose components in the ordinary
notation areqxp1 −q2,qyp1 −q2,qzp1 −q2,ip1 −q2(41)is the only 4-vector which can be formed from the velocity com-
ponents of the material particle which are defined in three di-
mensions byqx=dxdl, qy=dydl, qz=dzdl.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY49We therefore see thatmdxµdτ(42)must be that 4-vector which is to be equated to the 4-vector of
momentum and energy whose existence we have proved above.
By equating the components, we obtain, in three-dimensional
notation,Ix=mqxp1 −q2,Iy=mqyp1 −q2,Iz=mqzp1 −q2,E =mp1 −q2.(43)We recognize, in fact, that these components of momentumagree with those of classical mechanics for velocities which are
small compared to that of light. For large velocities the momen-
tum increases more rapidly than linearly with the velocity, so as
to become infinite on approaching the velocity of light.If we apply the last of equations(43)to a material particleat rest (q = 0), we see that the energy, E0, of a body at rest isequal to its mass. Had we chosen the second as our unit of time,
we would have obtainedE0=mc2.(44)Mass and energy are therefore essentially alike; they are only
different expressions for the same thing. The mass of a body
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY50is not a constant; it varies with changes in its energy.∗We seefrom the last of equations(43)thatE becomes infinite whenq approaches 1, the velocity of light. If we develop E in powers
ofq2, we obtain,E = m +m2q2+38mq4+. . . .(45)The second term of this expansion corresponds to the kinetic
energy of the material particle in classical mechanics.Equations of Motion of Material Particles.From(43)weobtain, by differentiating by the timel, and using the principleof momentum, in the notation of three-dimensional vectors,K =ddl mqp1 −q2!.(46)This equation, which was previously employed by H. A.Lorentz for the motion of electrons, has been proved to be true,
with great accuracy, by experiments withβ-rays.Energy Tensor of the Electromagnetic Field.Before the de-velopment of the theory of relativity it was known that the prin-
ciples of energy and momentum could be expressed in a differ-
ential form for the electromagnetic field. The four-dimensional
formulation of these principles leads to an important conception,∗The emission of energy in radioactive processes is evidently connectedwith the fact that the atomic weights are not integers. Attempts have been
made to draw conclusions from this concerning the structure and stability
of the atomic nuclei.
SPECIAL RELATIVITY51that of the energy tensor, which is important for the further de-
velopment of the theory of relativity.If in the expression for the 4-vector of force per unit volume,Kµ=φµνJν,using the field equations(32), we expressJνin terms of thefield intensities,φµν, we obtain, after some transformations andrepeated application of the field equations(32)and(33), theexpressionKµ= −∂Tµν∂xν,(47)where we have written∗Tµν= −14φαβ2δµν+φµαφνα.(48)The physical meaning of equation(47)becomes evident if inplace of this equation we write, using a new notation,kx= −∂pxx∂x−∂pxy∂y−∂pxz∂z−∂(ibx)∂(il),ky= −∂pyx∂x−∂pyy∂y−∂pyz∂z−∂(iby)∂(il),kz= −∂pzx∂x−∂pzy∂y−∂pzz∂z−∂(ibz)∂(il),iλ = −∂(isx)∂x−∂(isy)∂y−∂(isz)∂z−∂(−η)∂(il);(47a)∗To be summed for the indices α and β.

The last of
equations(47b)expresses the energy principle; s is the vectorflow of energy, andη the energy per unit volume of the field. Infact, we get from(48)by introducing the well-known expressionsfor the components of the field intensity from electrodynamics,pxx= − hxhx+12(hx2+ hy2+ hz2)− exex+12(ex2+ ey2+ ez2),pxy= − hxhypxz= − hxhz− exey,− exez,...bx= sx= eyhz− ezhy,by= sy= ezhx− exhz,bz= sz= exhy− eyhx,η = +12(ex2+ ey2+ ez2+ hx2+ hy2+ hz2).(48a)
SPECIAL RELATIVITY53We conclude from(48)that the energy tensor of the electro-magnetic field is symmetrical; with this is connected the fact
that the momentum per unit volume and the flow of energy are
equal to each other (relation between energy and inertia).We therefore conclude from these considerations that theenergy per unit volume has the character of a tensor. This has
been proved directly only for an electromagnetic field, although
we may claim universal validity for it. Maxwell’s equations de-
termine the electromagnetic field when the distribution of elec-
tric charges and currents is known. But we do not know the
laws which govern the currents and charges. We do know, in-
deed, that electricity consists of elementary particles (electrons,
positive nuclei), but from a theoretical point of view we can-
not comprehend this. We do not know the energy factors which
determine the distribution of electricity in particles of definite
size and charge, and all attempts to complete the theory in this
direction have failed. If then we can build upon Maxwell’s equa-
tions in general, the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field
is known only outside the charged particles.∗In these regions,outside of charged particles, the only regions in which we can be-
lieve that we have the complete expression for the energy tensor,
we have, by(47),∂Tµν∂xν= 0.(47c)∗It has been attempted to remedy this lack of knowledge by consideringthe charged particles as proper singularities. But in my opinion this means
giving up a real understanding of the structure of matter. It seems to me
much better to give in to our present inability rather than to be satisfied
by a solution that is only apparent.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY54General Expressions for the Conservation Principles.Wecan hardly avoid making the assumption that in all other cases,
also, the space distribution of energy is given by a symmetrical
tensor,Tµν, and that this complete energy tensor everywheresatisfies the relation(47c). At any rate we shall see that bymeans of this assumption we obtain the correct expression for
the integral energy principle.Let us consider a spatially bounded, closed system, which,four-dimensionally, we may represent as a strip, outside of which
theTµνvanish. Integrate equation(47c)over a space section.Since the integrals of∂Tµ1∂x1,∂Tµ2∂x2and∂Tµ3∂x3vanish becausetheTµνvanish at the limits of integration, we obtain∂∂lZTµ4dx1dx2dx3= 0.(49)Inside the parentheses are the expressions for the momentum of
the whole system, multiplied byi, together with the negativeenergy of the system, so that(49)expresses the conservationprinciples in their integral form. That this gives the right con-
ception of energy and the conservation principles will be seen
from the following considerations.Phenomenological Representation of theEnergy Tensor of Matter.Hydrodynamical Equations.We know that matter is builtup of electrically charged particles, but we do not know the laws
which govern the constitution of these particles. In treating me-
chanical problems, we are therefore obliged to make use of an
SPECIAL RELATIVITY55x1lFig. 3.inexact description of matter, which corresponds to that of clas-
sical mechanics. The densityσ, of a material substance and thehydrodynamical pressures are the fundamental concepts upon
which such a description is based.Letσ0be the density of matter at a place, estimated withreference to a system of co-ordinates moving with the matter.
Thenσ0, the density at rest, is an invariant. If we think of thematter in arbitrary motion and neglect the pressures (particles
of dust in vacuo, neglecting the size of the particles and the
temperature), then the energy tensor will depend only upon the
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY56velocity components,uνandσ0. We secure the tensor characterofTµνby puttingTµν=σ0uµuν,(50)in which theuµ, in the three-dimensional representation, aregiven by(41). In fact, it follows from(50)that forq = 0, T44=−σ0(equal to the negative energy per unit volume), as it should,according to the theorem of the equivalence of mass and energy,
and according to the physical interpretation of the energy tensor
given above. If an external force (four-dimensional vector,Kµ)acts upon the matter, by the principles of momentum and energy
the equationKµ=∂Tµν∂xνmust hold. We shall now show that this equation leads to the
same law of motion of a material particle as that already ob-
tained. Let us imagine the matter to be of infinitely small extent
in space, that is, a four-dimensional thread; then by integration
over the whole thread with respect to the space co-ordinates
x1,x2,x3, we obtainZK1dx1dx2dx3=Z∂T14∂x4dx1dx2dx3= −iddlZσ0dx1dτdx4dτdx1dx2dx3.NowRdx1dx2dx3dx4is an invariant, as is, therefore, alsoRσ0dx1dx2dx3dx4. We shall calculate this integral, first withrespect to the inertial system which we have chosen, and second,
with respect to a system relatively to which the matter has the
velocity zero. The integration is to be extended over a filament
SPECIAL RELATIVITY57of the thread for whichσ0may be regarded as constant over thewhole section. If the space volumes of the filament referred to
the two systems aredV and dV0respectively, then we haveZσ0dV dl =Zσ0dV0dτand therefore alsoZσ0dV =Zσ0dV0dτdl=Zdm idτdx4.If we substitute the right-hand side for the left-hand side inthe former integral, and putdx1dτoutside the sign of integration,we obtain,Kx=ddlmdx1dτ=ddl mqxp1 −q2!.We see, therefore, that the generalized conception of the energy
tensor is in agreement with our former result.The Eulerian Equations for Perfect Fluids.In order to getnearer to the behaviour of real matter we must add to the energy
tensor a term which corresponds to the pressures. The simplest
case is that of a perfect fluid in which the pressure is determined
by a scalarp. Since the tangential stresses pxy, etc., vanish inthis case, the contribution to the energy tensor must be of the
formpδνµ. We must therefore putTµν=σuµuν+pδµν.(51)
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY58At rest, the density of the matter, or the energy per unit volume,
is in this case, notσ but σ − p. For−T44= −σdx4dτdx4dτ−pδ44=σ − p.In the absence of any force, we have∂Tµν∂xν=σuν∂uµ∂xν+uµ∂(σuν)∂xν+∂p∂xµ= 0.If we multiply this equation byuµ=dxµdτand sum for theµ’s we obtain, using(40),−∂(σuν)∂xν+dpdτ= 0,(52)where we have put∂p∂xµdxµdτ=dpdτ. This is the equation ofcontinuity, which differs from that of classical mechanics bythe termdpdτ, which, practically, is vanishingly small. Observ-ing(52), the conservation principles take the formσduµdτ+uµdpdτ+∂p∂xµ= 0.(53)The equations for the first three indices evidently correspond to
the Eulerian equations. That the equations(52)and(53)cor-respond, to a first approximation, to the hydrodynamical equa-
tions of classical mechanics, is a further confirmation of the gen-
eralized energy principle. The density of matter and of energy
has the character of a symmetrical tensor.
LECTURE IIITHE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITYAllof the previous considerations have been based upon theassumption that all inertial systems are equivalent for the de-
scription of physical phenomena, but that they are preferred, for
the formulation of the laws of nature, to spaces of reference in a
different state of motion. We can think of no cause for this pref-
erence for definite states of motion to all others, according to our
previous considerations, either in the perceptible bodies or in the
concept of motion; on the contrary, it must be regarded as an in-
dependent property of the space-time continuum. The principle
of inertia, in particular, seems to compel us to ascribe physi-
cally objective properties to the space-time continuum. Just as
it was necessary from the Newtonian standpoint to make both
the statements, tempus est absolutum, spatium est absolutum, so
from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity we must
say, continuum spatii et temporis est absolutum. In this latter
statement absolutum means not only “physically real,” but also
“independent in its physical properties, having a physical effect,
but not itself influenced by physical conditions.”As long as the principle of inertia is regarded as the key-stone of physics, this standpoint is certainly the only one which
is justified. But there are two serious criticisms of the ordinary
conception. In the first place, it is contrary to the mode of think-
ing in science to conceive of a thing (the space-time continuum)
which acts itself, but which cannot be acted upon. This is the
reason why E. Mach was led to make the attempt to eliminate
space as an active cause in the system of mechanics. Accord-59
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY60ing to him, a material particle does not move in unaccelerated
motion relatively to space, but relatively to the centre of all the
other masses in the universe; in this way the series of causes of
mechanical phenomena was closed, in contrast to the mechanics
of Newton and Galileo. In order to develop this idea within the
limits of the modern theory of action through a medium, the
properties of the space-time continuum which determine inertia
must be regarded as field properties of space, analogous to the
electromagnetic field. The concepts of classical mechanics af-
ford no way of expressing this. For this reason Mach’s attempt
at a solution failed for the time being. We shall come back to
this point of view later. In the second place, classical mechanics
indicates a limitation which directly demands an extension of
the principle of relativity to spaces of reference which are not
in uniform motion relatively to each other. The ratio of the
masses of two bodies is defined in mechanics in two ways which
differ from each other fundamentally; in the first place, as the
reciprocal ratio of the accelerations which the same motional
force imparts to them (inert mass), and in the second place, as
the ratio of the forces which act upon them in the same grav-
itational field (gravitational mass). The equality of these two
masses, so differently defined, is a fact which is confirmed by
experiments of very high accuracy (experiments of E¨otv¨os), andclassical mechanics offers no explanation for this equality. It is,
however, clear that science is fully justified in assigning such a
numerical equality only after this numerical equality is reduced
to an equality of the real nature of the two concepts.That this object may actually be attained by an extensionof the principle of relativity, follows from the following consid-
eration. A little reflection will show that the theorem of the
THE GENERAL THEORY61equality of the inert and the gravitational mass is equivalent
to the theorem that the acceleration imparted to a body by a
gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For
Newton’s equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out
in full, is(Inert mass) · (Acceleration) = (Intensity of thegravitational field) · (Gravitational mass).It is only when there is numerical equality between the inert
and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of
the nature of the body. Let nowK be an inertial system. Masseswhich are sufficiently far from each other and from other bod-
ies are then, with respect toK, free from acceleration. We shallalso refer these masses to a system of co-ordinatesK0, uniformlyaccelerated with respect toK. Relatively to K0all the masseshave equal and parallel accelerations; with respect toK0theybehave just as if a gravitational field were present andK0wereunaccelerated. Overlooking for the present the question as to the
“cause” of such a gravitational field, which will occupy us later,
there is nothing to prevent our conceiving this gravitational field
as real, that is, the conception thatK0is “at rest” and a gravita-tional field is present we may consider as equivalent to the con-
ception that onlyK is an “allowable” system of co-ordinates andno gravitational field is present. The assumption of the complete
physical equivalence of the systems of co-ordinates,K and K0,we call the “principle of equivalence;” this principle is evidently
intimately connected with the theorem of the equality between
the inert and the gravitational mass, and signifies an extension
of the principle of relativity to co-ordinate systems which are in
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY62non-uniform motion relatively to each other. In fact, through
this conception we arrive at the unity of the nature of inertia
and gravitation. For according to our way of looking at it, the
same masses may appear to be either under the action of iner-
tia alone (with respect toK) or under the combined action ofinertia and gravitation (with respect toK0). The possibility ofexplaining the numerical equality of inertia and gravitation by
the unity of their nature gives to the general theory of relativity,
according to my conviction, such a superiority over the concep-
tions of classical mechanics, that all the difficulties encountered
in development must be considered as small in comparison.What justifies us in dispensing with the preference for in-ertial systems over all other co-ordinate systems, a preference
that seems so securely established by experiment based upon
the principle of inertia? The weakness of the principle of inertia
lies in this, that it involves an argument in a circle: a mass moves
without acceleration if it is sufficiently far from other bodies; we
know that it is sufficiently far from other bodies only by the fact
that it moves without acceleration. Are there, in general, any
inertial systems for very extended portions of the space-time
continuum, or, indeed, for the whole universe? We may look
upon the principle of inertia as established, to a high degree of
approximation, for the space of our planetary system, provided
that we neglect the perturbations due to the sun and planets.
Stated more exactly, there are finite regions, where, with respect
to a suitably chosen space of reference, material particles move
freely without acceleration, and in which the laws of the spe-
cial theory of relativity, which have been developed above, hold
with remarkable accuracy. Such regions we shall call “Galilean
regions.” We shall proceed from the consideration of such re-
THE GENERAL THEORY63gions as a special case of known properties.The principle of equivalence demands that in dealing withGalilean regions we may equally well make use of non-inertial
systems, that is, such co-ordinate systems as, relatively to in-
ertial systems, are not free from acceleration and rotation. If,
further, we are going to do away completely with the difficult
question as to the objective reason for the preference of certain
systems of co-ordinates, then we must allow the use of arbitrar-
ily moving systems of co-ordinates. As soon as we make this
attempt seriously we come into conflict with that physical inter-
pretation of space and time to which we were led by the special
theory of relativity. For letK0be a system of co-ordinates whosez0-axis coincides with thez-axis of K, and which rotates aboutthe latter axis with constant angular velocity. Are the configura-
tions of rigid bodies, at rest relatively toK0, in accordance withthe laws of Euclidean geometry? SinceK0is not an inertial sys-tem, we do not know directly the laws of configuration of rigid
bodies with respect toK0, nor the laws of nature, in general. Butwe do know these laws with respect to the inertial systemK,and we can therefore estimate them with respect toK0. Imaginea circle drawn about the origin in thex0-y0plane ofK0, and adiameter of this circle. Imagine, further, that we have given a
large number of rigid rods, all equal to each other. We suppose
these laid in series along the periphery and the diameter of the
circle, at rest relatively toK0. IfU is the number of these rodsalong the periphery,D the number along the diameter, then, ifK0does not rotate relatively toK, we shall haveUD=π.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY64But ifK0rotates we get a different result. Suppose that ata definite timet of K we determine the ends of all the rods.With respect toK all the rods upon the periphery experiencethe Lorentz contraction, but the rods upon the diameter do not
experience this contraction (along their lengths!).∗It thereforefollows thatUD> π.It therefore follows that the laws of configuration of rigidbodies with respect toK0do not agree with the laws of configura-tion of rigid bodies that are in accordance with Euclidean geom-
etry. If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating withK0),one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the cir-
cle, then, judged fromK, the clock on the periphery will goslower than the clock at the centre. The same thing must take
place, judged fromK0, if we define time with respect toK0in anot wholly unnatural way, that is, in such a way that the laws
with respect toK0depend explicitly upon the time. Space andtime, therefore, cannot be defined with respect toK0as theywere in the special theory of relativity with respect to inertial
systems. But, according to the principle of equivalence,K0isalso to be considered as a system at rest, with respect to which
there is a gravitational field (field of centrifugal force, and force
of Coriolis). We therefore arrive at the result: the gravitational
field influences and even determines the metrical laws of the
space-time continuum. If the laws of configuration of ideal rigid
bodies are to be expressed geometrically, then in the presence∗These considerations assume that the behaviour of rods and clocksdepends only upon velocities, and not upon accelerations, or, at least, that
the influence of acceleration does not counteract that of velocity.
THE GENERAL THEORY65of a gravitational field the geometry is not Euclidean.The case that we have been considering is analogous to thatwhich is presented in the two-dimensional treatment of sur-
faces. It is impossible in the latter case also, to introduce co-
ordinates on a surface (e.g. the surface of an ellipsoid) which
have a simple metrical significance, while on a plane the Carte-
sian co-ordinates,x1,x2, signify directly lengths measured by aunit measuring rod. Gauss overcame this difficulty, in his the-
ory of surfaces, by introducing curvilinear co-ordinates which,
apart from satisfying conditions of continuity, were wholly ar-
bitrary, and afterwards these co-ordinates were related to the
metrical properties of the surface.In an analogous way weshall introduce in the general theory of relativity arbitrary co-
ordinates,x1,x2,x3,x4, which shall number uniquely the space-time points, so that neighbouring events are associated with
neighbouring values of the co-ordinates; otherwise, the choice
of co-ordinates is arbitrary. We shall be true to the principle
of relativity in its broadest sense if we give such a form to the
laws that they are valid in every such four-dimensional system
of co-ordinates, that is, if the equations expressing the laws are
co-variant with respect to arbitrary transformations.The most important point of contact between Gauss’s theoryof surfaces and the general theory of relativity lies in the metri-
cal properties upon which the concepts of both theories, in the
main, are based. In the case of the theory of surfaces, Gauss’s
argument is as follows. Plane geometry may be based upon the
concept of the distanceds, between two indefinitely near points.The concept of this distance is physically significant because
the distance can be measured directly by means of a rigid mea-
suring rod. By a suitable choice of Cartesian co-ordinates this
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY66distance may be expressed by the formulads2=dx12+dx22.We may base upon this quantity the concepts of the straight
line as the geodesic (δRds = 0), the interval, the circle, and theangle, upon which the Euclidean plane geometry is built. A
geometry may be developed upon another continuously curved
surface, if we observe that an infinitesimally small portion of the
surface may be regarded as plane, to within relatively infinitesi-
mal quantities. There are Cartesian co-ordinates,X1,X2, uponsuch a small portion of the surface, and the distance between
two points, measured by a measuring rod, is given byds2=dX12+dX22.If we introduce arbitrary curvilinear co-ordinates,x1,x2, on thesurface, thendX1,dX2, may be expressed linearly in terms ofdx1,dx2. Then everywhere upon the surface we haveds2=g11dx12+ 2g12dx1dx2+g22dx22,whereg11,g12,g22are determined by the nature of the surfaceand the choice of co-ordinates; if these quantities are known,
then it is also known how networks of rigid rods may be laid
upon the surface. In other words, the geometry of surfaces may
be based upon this expression fords2exactly as plane geometryis based upon the corresponding expression.There are analogous relations in the four-dimensional space-time continuum of physics. In the immediate neighbourhood of
an observer, falling freely in a gravitational field, there exists no
gravitational field. We can therefore always regard an infinites-
imally small region of the space-time continuum as Galilean.
For such an infinitely small region there will be an inertial sys-
tem (with the space co-ordinates,X1,X2,X3, and the time
THE GENERAL THEORY67co-ordinateX4) relatively to which we are to regard the laws ofthe special theory of relativity as valid. The quantity which is
directly measurable by our unit measuring rods and clocks,dX12+dX22+dX32−dX42,or its negative,ds2= −dX12−dX22−dX32+dX42,(54)is therefore a uniquely determinate invariant for two neighbour-
ing events (points in the four-dimensional continuum), provided
that we use measuring rods that are equal to each other when
brought together and superimposed, and clocks whose rates are
the same when they are brought together. In this the physical
assumption is essential that the relative lengths of two measur-
ing rods and the relative rates of two clocks are independent, in
principle, of their previous history. But this assumption is cer-
tainly warranted by experience; if it did not hold there could be
no sharp spectral lines; for the single atoms of the same element
certainly do not have the same history, and it would be absurd
to suppose any relative difference in the structure of the single
atoms due to their previous history if the mass and frequencies
of the single atoms of the same element were always the same.Space-time regions of finite extent are, in general, notGalilean, so that a gravitational field cannot be done away
with by any choice of co-ordinates in a finite region.Thereis, therefore, no choice of co-ordinates for which the metrical
relations of the special theory of relativity hold in a finite re-
gion. But the invariantds always exists for two neighbouringpoints (events) of the continuum. This invariantds may be
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY68expressed in arbitrary co-ordinates. If one observes that the
localdXνmay be expressed linearly in terms of the co-ordinatedifferentialsdxν,ds2may be expressed in the formds2=gµνdxµdxν.(55)The functionsgµνdescribe, with respect to the arbitrar-ily chosen system of co-ordinates, the metrical relations of the
space-time continuum and also the gravitational field. As in
the special theory of relativity, we have to discriminate between
time-like and space-like line elements in the four-dimensional
continuum; owing to the change of sign introduced, time-like line
elements have a real, space-like line elements an imaginaryds.The time-likeds can be measured directly by a suitably chosenclock.According to what has been said, it is evident that the formu-lation of the general theory of relativity assumes a generalization
of the theory of invariants and the theory of tensors; the ques-
tion is raised as to the form of the equations which are co-variant
with respect to arbitrary point transformations. The generalized
calculus of tensors was developed by mathematicians long be-
fore the theory of relativity. Riemann first extended Gauss’s
train of thought to continua of any number of dimensions; with
prophetic vision he saw the physical meaning of this general-
ization of Euclid’s geometry. Then followed the development of
the theory in the form of the calculus of tensors, particularly by
Ricci and Levi-Civita. This is the place for a brief presentation
of the most important mathematical concepts and operations of
this calculus of tensors.We designate four quantities, which are defined as functionsof thexνwith respect to every system of co-ordinates, as com-
THE GENERAL THEORY69ponents,Aν, of a contra-variant vector, if they transform in achange of co-ordinates as the co-ordinate differentialsdxν. Wetherefore haveA0µ=∂x0µ∂xνAν.(56)Besides these contra-variant vectors, there are also co-variant
vectors. IfBνare the components of a co-variant vector, thesevectors are transformed according to the ruleB0µ=∂xν∂x0µBν.(57)The definition of a co-variant vector is chosen in such a way that
a co-variant vector and a contra-variant vector together form a
scalar according to the scheme,φ = BνAν(summed over theν).Accordingly,B0µA0µ=∂xα∂x0µ∂x0µ∂xβBαAβ=BαAα.In particular, the derivatives∂φ∂xαof a scalarφ, are componentsof a co-variant vector, which, with the co-ordinate differentials,form the scalar∂φ∂xαdxα; we see from this example how naturalis the definition of the co-variant vectors.There are here, also, tensors of any rank, which may haveco-variant or contra-variant character with respect to each in-
dex; as with vectors, the character is designated by the position
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY70of the index. For example,Aν
µdenotes a tensor of the secondrank, which is co-variant with respect to the indexµ, and contra-variant with respect to the indexν. The tensor character indi-cates that the equation of transformation isA0νµ=∂xα∂x0µ∂x0ν∂xβAβ
α.(58)Tensors may be formed by the addition and subtraction oftensors of equal rank and like character, as in the theory of
invariants of orthogonal linear substitutions, for example,Aν
µ+Bνµ=Cνµ.(59)The proof of the tensor character ofCνµdepends upon(58).Tensors may be formed by multiplication, keeping the char-acter of the indices, just as in the theory of invariants of linear
orthogonal transformations, for example,Aν
µBστ=Cνµστ.(60)The proof follows directly from the rule of transformation.Tensors may be formed by contraction with respect to twoindices of different character, for example,Aµ
µστ=Bστ.(61)The tensor character ofAµ
µστdetermines the tensor characterofBστ. Proof—A0µµστ=∂xα∂x0µ∂x0µ∂xβ∂xs∂x0σ∂xt∂x0τAβ

THE GENERAL THEORY71The properties of symmetry and skew-symmetry of a ten-sor with respect to two indices of like character have the same
significance as in the theory of invariants.With this, everything essential has been said with regard tothe algebraic properties of tensors.The Fundamental Tensor.It follows from the invarianceofds2for an arbitrary choice of thedxν, in connexion withthe condition of symmetry consistent with(55), that thegµνare components of a symmetrical co-variant tensor (Fundamen-
tal Tensor). Let us form the determinant,g, of the gµν, andalso the minors, divided byg, corresponding to the single gµν.These minors, divided byg, will be denoted by gµν, and theirco-variant character is not yet known. Then we havegµαgµβ=δβα=(1ifα = β,0ifα 6= β.(62)If we form the infinitely small quantities (co-variant vectors)dξµ=gµαdxα,(63)multiply bygµβand sum over theµ, we obtain, by the useof(62),dxβ=gβµdξµ.(64)Since the ratios of thedξµare arbitrary, and thedxβas well asthedxµare components of vectors, it follows that thegµνare thecomponents of a contra-variant tensor∗(contra-variant funda-mental tensor). The tensor character ofδβα(mixed fundamental∗If we multiply(64)by∂x0α∂xβ, sum over the β, and replace the dξµby
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY72tensor) accordingly follows, by(62). By means of the fundamen-tal tensor, instead of tensors with co-variant index character, we
can introduce tensors with contra-variant index character, and
conversely. For example,Aµ=gµαAα,Aµ=gµαAα,Tσµ=gσνTµν.Volume Invariants.The volume elementZdx1dx2dx3dx4=dxis not an invariant. For by Jacobi’s theorem,dx0=

dx.(65)But we can complementdx so that it becomes an invariant. Ifwe form the determinant of the quantitiesg0µν=∂xα∂x0µ∂xβ∂x0νgαβ,a transformation to the accented system, we obtaindx0α=∂x0σ∂xµ∂x0α∂xβgµβdξ0σ.The statement made above follows from this, since, by(64), we must alsohave dx0α= gσα0dξ0α, and both equations must hold for every choice ofthe dξ0σ.

tion of determinants,g0= |g0µν| =

simple as in the special case of invariance with respect to lin-
ear orthogonal transformations, nevertheless in the general case,
the invariant differential operations are, unfortunately, consid-
erably more complicated. The reason for this is as follows. If
Aµis a contra-variant vector, the coefficients of its transforma-tion,∂x0µ∂xν, are independent of position only if the transformationis a linear one. For then the vector components,Aµ+∂Aµ∂xαdxα,at a neighbouring point transform in the same way as theAµ,from which follows the vector character of the vector differen-tials, and the tensor character of∂Aµ∂xα. But if the∂x0µ∂xνarevariable this is no longer true.That there are, nevertheless, in the general case, invariantdifferential operations for tensors, is recognized most satisfacto-
rily in the following way, introduced by Levi-Civita and Weyl.
Let (Aµ) be a contra-variant vector whose components are givenwith respect to the co-ordinate system of thexν. LetP1andP2
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY74be two infinitesimally near points of the continuum. For the in-
finitesimal region surrounding the pointP1, there is, accordingto our way of considering the matter, a co-ordinate system of
theXν(with imaginaryX4-co-ordinate) for which the contin-uum is Euclidean. LetAµ
(1)be the co-ordinates of the vector atthe pointP1. Imagine a vector drawn at the pointP2, using thelocal system of theXν, with the same co-ordinates (parallel vec-tor throughP2), then this parallel vector is uniquely determinedby the vector atP1and the displacement. We designate this op-eration, whose uniqueness will appear in the sequel, the parallel
displacement of the vectorAµfromP1to the infinitesimally nearpointP2. If we form the vector difference of the vector (Aµ) atthe pointP2and the vector obtained by parallel displacementfromP1toP2, we get a vector which may be regarded as thedifferential of the vector (Aµ) for the given displacement (dxν).This vector displacement can naturally also be consideredwith respect to the co-ordinate system of thexν. IfAνare theco-ordinates of the vector atP1,Aν+δAνthe co-ordinates ofthe vector displaced toP2along the interval (dxν), then theδAνdo not vanish in this case. We know of these quantities, which
do not have a vector character, that they must depend linearly
and homogeneously upon thedxνand theAν. We therefore putδAν= −Γν
αβAαdxβ.(67)In addition, we can state that the Γν
αβmust be symmetricalwith respect to the indicesα and β. For we can assume froma representation by the aid of a Euclidean system of local co-
ordinates that the same parallelogram will be described by the
displacement of an elementd(1)xνalong a second elementd(2)xν
THE GENERAL THEORY75as by a displacement ofd(2)xνalongd(1)xν. We must thereforehaved(2)xν+ (d(1)xν− Γν
αβd(1)xαd(2)xβ)=d(1)xν+ (d(2)xν− Γν
αβd(2)xαd(1)xβ).The statement made above follows from this, after interchanging
the indices of summation,α and β, on the right-hand side.Since the quantitiesgµνdetermine all the metrical propertiesof the continuum, they must also determine the Γν
αβ.If weconsider the invariant of the vectorAν, that is, the square of itsmagnitude,gµνAµAν,which is an invariant, this cannot change in a parallel displace-
ment. We therefore have0 =δ(gµνAµAν) =∂gµν∂xαAµAνdxα+gµνAµδAν+gµνAνδAµor, by(67),∂gµν∂xα−gµβΓβ

the indices. By a cyclic interchange of the indicesµ, ν, α, weobtain thus altogether three equations, from which we obtain,

fromP1toP2, and (Aµ+dAµ) the vectorAµat the pointP2,then the difference of these two,dAµ−δAµ=∂Aµ∂xσ+ Γµ
σαAαdxσ,is also a vector. Since this is the case for an arbitrary choice of
thedxσ, it follows thatAµ; σ=∂Aµ∂xσ+ Γµ
σαAα(71)is a tensor, which we designate as the co-variant derivative of
the tensor of the first rank (vector). Contracting this tensor, we
obtain the divergence of the contra-variant tensorAµ. In thiswe must observe that according to(70),Γσ
µσ=12gσα∂gσα∂xµ=1√g∂√g∂xµ.(72)
THE GENERAL THEORY77If we put, further,Aµ√g = Aµ,(73)a quantity designated by Weyl as the contra-variant tensor den-
sity∗of the first rank, it follows that,A=∂ Aµ∂xµ(74)is a scalar density.We get the law of parallel displacement for the co-variantvectorBµby stipulating that the parallel displacement shall beeffected in such a way that the scalarφ = AµBµremains unchanged, and that thereforeAµδBµ+BµδAµvanishes for every value assigned to (Aµ). We therefore getδBµ= Γα
µσAαdxσ.(75)From this we arrive at the co-variant derivative of the co-variant vector by the same process as that which led to(71),Bµ; σ=∂Bµ∂xσ− Γα
µσBα.(76)∗This expression is justified, in that Aµ√g dx = Aµdx has a tensorcharacter. Every tensor, when multiplied by√g, changes into a tensordensity. We employ capital Gothic letters for tensor densities.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY78By interchanging the indicesµ and β, and subtracting, we getthe skew-symmetrical tensor,φµσ=∂Bµ∂xσ−∂Bσ∂xµ.(77)For the co-variant differentiation of tensors of the secondand higher ranks we may use the process by which(75)wasdeduced. Let, for example, (Aστ) be a co-variant tensor of thesecond rank. ThenAστEσFτis a scalar, ifE and F are vectors.This expression must not be changed by theδ-displacement;expressing this by a formula, we get, using(67),δAστ, whencewe get the desired co-variant derivative,Aστ; ρ=∂Aστ∂xρ− Γα
σρAατ− Γα

αρAα

formulæ we shall deduce some others which are of interest for
the physical applications of the theory.In caseAστis skew-symmetrical, we obtain the tensorAστ ρ=∂Aστ∂xρ+∂Aτ ρ∂xσ+∂Aρσ∂xτ,(81)
THE GENERAL THEORY79which is skew-symmetrical in all pairs of indices, by cyclic inter-
change and addition.If, in(78), we replaceAστby the fundamental tensor,gστ,then the right-hand side vanishes identically; an analogous state-
ment holds for(80)with respect togστ; that is, the co-variantderivatives of the fundamental tensor vanish. That this must be
so we see directly in the local system of co-ordinates.In caseAστis skew-symmetrical, we obtain from(80), bycontraction with respect toτ and ρ,Aσ=∂ Aστ∂xτ.(82)In the general case, from(79)and(80), by contraction withrespect toτ and ρ, we obtain the equations,Aσ=∂ Aα

If the continuum is Euclidean (more gener-ally, if by a suitable choice of co-ordinates thegµνare constants)then the vector obtained atG as a result of this displacementdoes not depend upon the choice of the curve joiningP and G.But otherwise, the result depends upon the path of the displace-
ment. In this case, therefore, a vector suffers a change, ∆Aµ(in its direction, not its magnitude), when it is carried from a

a closed curve, this problem may be reduced to the integration
around a closed curve with infinitely small linear dimensions; we
shall limit ourselves to this case.We have, first, by(67),∆Aµ= −IΓµ
αβAαdxβ.In this, Γµ
αβis the value of this quantity at the variablepointG of the path of integration. If we putξµ= (xµ)G− (xµ)P

of the first order, ∆Aµis infinitely small of the second order.Therefore there is an error of only the second order if we putAα=Aα− Γα
στAσξτ.If we introduce these values of Γµ

and position.If the expression in the brackets in(85)wereskew-symmetrical with respect to the indicesα and β, we could
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY82conclude its tensor character from(85). We can accomplish thisby interchanging the summation indicesα and β in(85)andadding the resulting equation to(85). We obtain2∆Aµ= −Rµ

condition (disregarding the reality of the chosen co-ordinates)
that the continuum is Euclidean.By contraction of the Riemann tensor with respect to theindicesµ, β, we obtain the symmetrical tensor of the secondrank,Rµν= −∂Γα

LECTURE IVTHE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY(continued )Weare now in possession of the mathematical apparatus whichis necessary to formulate the laws of the general theory of rel-
ativity. No attempt will be made in this presentation at sys-
tematic completeness, but single results and possibilities will
be developed progressively from what is known and from the re-
sults obtained. Such a presentation is most suited to the present
provisional state of our knowledge.A material particle upon which no force acts moves, accord-ing to the principle of inertia, uniformly in a straight line. In
the four-dimensional continuum of the special theory of relativ-
ity (with real time co-ordinate) this is a real straight line. The
natural, that is, the simplest, generalization of the straight line
which is plausible in the system of concepts of Riemann’s gen-
eral theory of invariants is that of the straightest, or geodetic,
line. We shall accordingly have to assume, in the sense of the
principle of equivalence, that the motion of a material particle,
under the action only of inertia and gravitation, is described by
the equation,d2xµds2+ Γµ
αβdxαdsdxβds= 0.(90)In fact, this equation reduces to that of a straight line if all the
components, Γµ
αβ, of the gravitational field vanish.How are these equations connected with Newton’s equationsof motion? According to the special theory of relativity, thegµνas well as thegµν, have the values, with respect to an inertial84
THE GENERAL THEORY85system (with real time co-ordinate and suitable choice of the
sign ofds2),−10000−10000−100001.(91)The equations of motion then becomed2xµds2= 0.We shall call this the “first approximation” to thegµν-field. Inconsidering approximations it is often useful, as in the special
theory of relativity, to use an imaginaryx4-co-ordinate, as thenthegµν, to the first approximation, assume the values−10000−10000−10000−1.(91a)These values may be collected in the relationgµν= −δµν.To the second approximation we must then putgµν= −δµν+γµν,(92)where theγµνare to be regarded as small of the first order.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY86Both terms of our equation of motion are then small of thefirst order. If we neglect terms which, relatively to these, are
small of the first order, we have to putds2= −dxν2=dl2(1 −q2),(93)Γµ
αβ= −δµσαβσ = − αβµ =12∂γαβ∂xµ−∂γαµ∂xβ−∂γβµ∂xα. (94)We shall now introduce an approximation of a second kind. Let
the velocity of the material particles be very small compared to
that of light. Thends will be the same as the time differen-tial,dl. Further,dx1ds,dx2ds,dx3dswill vanish compared todx4ds.We shall assume, in addition, that the gravitational field varies
so little with the time that the derivatives of theγµνbyx4maybe neglected. Then the equation of motion (forµ = 1, 2, 3)reduces tod2xµdl2=∂∂xµγ442 .(90a)This equation is identical with Newton’s equation of motion fora material particle in a gravitational field, if we identifyγ442with the potential of the gravitational field; whether or not this
is allowable, naturally depends upon the field equations of grav-
itation, that is, it depends upon whether or not this quantity
satisfies, to a first approximation, the same laws of the field
as the gravitational potential in Newton’s theory. A glance at(90)and(90a)shows that the Γµ
αβactually do play the rˆole ofthe intensity of the gravitational field. These quantities do not
have a tensor character.Equations(90)express the influence of inertia and gravita-tion upon the material particle. The unity of inertia and gravi-
THE GENERAL THEORY87tation is formally expressed by the fact that the whole left-hand
side of(90)has the character of a tensor (with respect to anytransformation of co-ordinates), but the two terms taken sep-
arately do not have tensor character, so that, in analogy with
Newton’s equations, the first term would be regarded as the ex-
pression for inertia, and the second as the expression for the
gravitational force.We must next attempt to find the laws of the gravitationalfield. For this purpose, Poisson’s equation,∆φ = 4πKρof the Newtonian theory must serve as a model. This equa-
tion has its foundation in the idea that the gravitational field
arises from the densityρ of ponderable matter. It must alsobe so in the general theory of relativity. But our investigations
of the special theory of relativity have shown that in place of
the scalar density of matter we have the tensor of energy per
unit volume. In the latter is included not only the tensor of
the energy of ponderable matter, but also that of the electro-
magnetic energy. We have seen, indeed, that in a more complete
analysis the energy tensor can be regarded only as a provisional
means of representing matter. In reality, matter consists of elec-
trically charged particles, and is to be regarded itself as a part,
in fact, the principal part, of the electromagnetic field. It is
only the circumstance that we have not sufficient knowledge of
the electromagnetic field of concentrated charges that compels
us, provisionally, to leave undetermined in presenting the the-
ory, the true form of this tensor. From this point of view our
problem now is to introduce a tensor,Tµν, of the second rank,
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY88whose structure we do not know provisionally, and which in-
cludes in itself the energy density of the electromagnetic field
and of ponderable matter; we shall denote this in the following
as the “energy tensor of matter.”According to our previous results, the principles of momen-tum and energy are expressed by the statement that the diver-
gence of this tensor vanishes(47c). In the general theory of rela-tivity, we shall have to assume as valid the corresponding general
co-variant equation. If (Tµν) denotes the co-variant energy ten-sor of matter, Tν
σthe corresponding mixed tensor density, then,in accordance with(83), we must require that0 =∂ Tα
σ∂xα− Γα
σβTβ
α(95)be satisfied. It must be remembered that besides the energy den-
sity of the matter there must also be given an energy density of
the gravitational field, so that there can be no talk of principles
of conservation of energy and momentum for matter alone. This
is expressed mathematically by the presence of the second term
in(95), which makes it impossible to conclude the existence ofan integral equation of the form of(49). The gravitational fieldtransfers energy and momentum to the “matter,” in that it ex-
erts forces upon it and gives it energy; this is expressed by the
second term in(95).If there is an analogue of Poisson’s equation in the generaltheory of relativity, then this equation must be a tensor equa-
tion for the tensorgµνof the gravitational potential; the en-ergy tensor of matter must appear on the right-hand side of this
equation. On the left-hand side of the equation there must be
a differential tensor in thegµν. We have to find this differen-
THE GENERAL THEORY89tial tensor. It is completely determined by the following three
conditions:—1. It may contain no differential coefficients of thegµνhigherthan the second.2. It must be linear and homogeneous in these second differ-ential coefficients.3. Its divergence must vanish identically.
The first two of these conditions are naturally taken fromPoisson’s equation.Since it may be proved mathematicallythat all such differential tensors can be formed algebraically
(i.e. without differentiation) from Riemann’s tensor, our tensor
must be of the formRµν+agµνR,in whichRµνandR are defined by(88)and(89)respectively.Further, it may be proved that the third condition requiresato have the value −12. For the law of the gravitational field wetherefore get the equationRµν−12gµνR = −κTµν.(96)Equation(95)is a consequence of this equation.κ denotes aconstant, which is connected with the Newtonian gravitation
constant.In the following I shall indicate the features of the theorywhich are interesting from the point of view of physics, using as
little as possible of the rather involved mathematical method.
It must first be shown that the divergence of the left-hand side
actually vanishes. The energy principle for matter may be ex-

side at this point. At this point the components Γα
σβvanish, sothat we have to prove the vanishing only of∂∂xσ√−g gνσ(Rµν−12gµνR) .Introducing(88)and(70)into this expression, we see that theonly terms that remain are those in which third derivatives of
thegµνenter. Since thegµνare to be replaced by −δµν, we ob-tain, finally, only a few terms which may easily be seen to cancel
each other. Since the quantity that we have formed has a tensor
character, its vanishing is proved for every other system of co-
ordinates also, and naturally for every other four-dimensional
point. The energy principle of matter(97)is thus a mathemat-ical consequence of the field equations(96).In order to learn whether the equations(96)are consistentwith experience, we must, above all else, find out whether they
THE GENERAL THEORY91lead to the Newtonian theory as a first approximation. For this
purpose we must introduce various approximations into these
equations. We already know that Euclidean geometry and the
law of the constancy of the velocity of light are valid, to a certain
approximation, in regions of a great extent, as in the planetary
system. If, as in the special theory of relativity, we take the
fourth co-ordinate imaginary, this means that we must putgµν= −δµν+γµν,(98)in which theγµνare so small compared to 1 that we can neglectthe higher powers of theγµνand their derivatives. If we do this,we learn nothing about the structure of the gravitational field, or
of metrical space of cosmical dimensions, but we do learn about
the influence of neighbouring masses upon physical phenomena.Before carrying through this approximation we shall trans-form(96). We multiply(96)bygµν, summed over theµ and ν;observing the relation which follows from the definition of
thegµν,gµνgµν= 4,we obtain the equationR = κgµνTµν=κT.If we put this value ofR in(96)we obtainRµν= −κ(Tµν−12gµνT ) = −κT∗µν.(96a)When the approximation which has been mentioned is carried
out, we obtain for the left-hand side,−12∂2γµν∂xα2+∂2γαα∂xµ∂xν−∂2γµα∂xν∂xα−∂2γνα∂xµ∂xα
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY92or−12∂2γµν∂xα2+12∂∂xν∂γ0µα∂xα+12∂∂xµ∂γ0να∂xα,in which has been putγ0µν=γµν−12γσσδµν.(99)We must now note that equation(96)is valid for any sys-tem of co-ordinates. We have already specialized the system of
co-ordinates in that we have chosen it so that within the region
considered thegµνdiffer infinitely little from the constant val-ues −δµν. But this condition remains satisfied in any infinitesi-mal change of co-ordinates, so that there are still four conditions
to which theγµνmay be subjected, provided these conditionsdo not conflict with the conditions for the order of magnitude of
theγµν. We shall now assume that the system of co-ordinatesis so chosen that the four relations—0 =∂γ0µν∂xν=∂γµν∂xν−12∂γσσ∂xµ(100)are satisfied. Then(96a)takes the form∂2γµν∂xα2= 2κT∗µν.(96b)These equations may be solved by the method, familiar in
electrodynamics, of retarded potentials; we get, in an easily
understood notation,γµν= −κ2πZT∗µν(x0, y0, z0, t − r)rdV0.(101)
THE GENERAL THEORY93In order to see in what sense this theory contains the New-tonian theory, we must consider in greater detail the energy
tensor of matter. Considered phenomenologically, this energy
tensor is composed of that of the electromagnetic field and of
matter in the narrower sense. If we consider the different parts
of this energy tensor with respect to their order of magnitude,
it follows from the results of the special theory of relativity that
the contribution of the electromagnetic field practically vanishes
in comparison to that of ponderable matter. In our system of
units, the energy of one gram of matter is equal to 1, compared
to which the energy of the electric fields may be ignored, and
also the energy of deformation of matter, and even the chemical
energy. We get an approximation that is fully sufficient for our
purpose if we putTµν=σdxµdsdxνds,ds2=gµνdxµdxν.(102)In this,σ is the density at rest, that is, the density of the pon-derable matter, in the ordinary sense, measured with the aid
of a unit measuring rod, and referred to a Galilean system of
co-ordinates moving with the matter.We observe, further, that in the co-ordinates we have chosen,we shall make only a relatively small error if we replace thegµνby −δµν, so that we putds2= −X dxµ2.(102a)The previous developments are valid however rapidly themasses which generate the field may move relatively to our cho-
sen system of quasi-Galilean co-ordinates. But in astronomy
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY94we have to do with masses whose velocities, relatively to the
co-ordinate system employed, are always small compared to the
velocity of light, that is, small compared to 1, with our choice
of the unit of time. We therefore get an approximation which is
sufficient for nearly all practical purposes if in(101)we replacethe retarded potential by the ordinary (non-retarded) potential,
and if, for the masses which generate the field, we putdx1ds=dx2ds=dx3ds= 0,dx4ds=√−1dldl=√−1.(103)Then we get forTµνandTµνthe values000000000000000−σ.(104)ForT we get the value σ, and, finally, for T∗µνthe values,σ20000σ20000σ20000−σ2.(104a)We thus get, from(101),γ11=γ22=γ33= −κ4πZσ dV0r,γ44= +κ4πZσ dV0r,(101a)
THE GENERAL THEORY95while all the otherγµνvanish. The least of these equations,in connexion with equation(90a), contains Newton’s theory ofgravitation. If we replacel by ct we getd2xµdt2=κc28π∂∂xµZσ dV0r.(90b)We see that the Newtonian gravitation constantK, is connectedwith the constantκ that enters into our field equations by therelationK =κc28π.(105)From the known numerical value ofK, it therefore follows thatκ =8πKc2=8π · 6.67 · 10−89 · 1020= 1.86 · 10−27.(105a)From(101)we see that even in the first approximation the struc-ture of the gravitational field differs fundamentally from that
which is consistent with the Newtonian theory; this difference
lies in the fact that the gravitational potential has the character
of a tensor and not a scalar. This was not recognized in the past
because only the componentg44, to a first approximation, entersthe equations of motion of material particles.In order now to be able to judge the behaviour of measuringrods and clocks from our results, we must observe the following.
According to the principle of equivalence, the metrical relations
of the Euclidean geometry are valid relatively to a Cartesian
system of reference of infinitely small dimensions, and in a suit-
able state of motion (freely falling, and without rotation). We
can make the same statement for local systems of co-ordinates
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY96which, relatively to these, have small accelerations, and there-
fore for such systems of co-ordinates as are at rest relatively to
the one we have selected. For such a local system, we have, for
two neighbouring point events,ds2= −dX12−dX22−dX32+dT2= −dS2+dT2,wheredS is measured directly by a measuring rod and dT bya clock at rest relatively to the system; these are the naturally
measured lengths and times. Sinceds2, on the other hand, isknown in terms of the co-ordinatesxνemployed in finite regions,in the formds2=gµνdxµdxν,we have the possibility of getting the relation between naturally
measured lengths and times, on the one hand, and the corre-
sponding differences of co-ordinates, on the other hand. As the
division into space and time is in agreement with respect to the
two systems of co-ordinates, so when we equate the two expres-
sions fords2we get two relations. If, by(101a), we putds2= −1 +κ4πZσ dV0r(dx12+dx22+dx32)+1 −κ4πZσ dV0rdl2,we obtain, to a sufficiently close approximation,pdX12+dX22+dX32=1 +κ8πZσ dV0rpdx12+dx22+dx32,dT =1 −κ8πZσ dV0rdl.(106)
THE GENERAL THEORY97The unit measuring rod has therefore the length,1 −κ8πZσ dV0rin respect to the system of co-ordinates we have selected. The
particular system of co-ordinates we have selected insures that
this length shall depend only upon the place, and not upon the
direction. If we had chosen a different system of co-ordinates
this would not be so. But however we may choose a system of
co-ordinates, the laws of configuration of rigid rods do not agree
with those of Euclidean geometry; in other words, we cannot
choose any system of co-ordinates so that the co-ordinate differ-
ences, ∆x1, ∆x2, ∆x3, corresponding to the ends of a unit mea-suring rod, oriented in any way, shall always satisfy the relation
∆x12+ ∆x22+ ∆x32= 1. In this sense space is not Euclidean,but “curved.” It follows from the second of the relations above
that the interval between two beats of the unit clock (dT = 1)corresponds to the “time”1 +κ8πZσ dV0rin the unit used in our system of co-ordinates. The rate of a
clock is accordingly slower the greater is the mass of the ponder-
able matter in its neighbourhood. We therefore conclude that
spectral lines which are produced on the sun’s surface will be
displaced towards the red, compared to the corresponding lines
produced on the earth, by about 2 · 10−6of their wave-lengths.At first, this important consequence of the theory appeared to
conflict with experiment; but results obtained during the past
year seem to make the existence of this effect more probable, and
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY98it can hardly be doubted that this consequence of the theory will
be confirmed within the next year.Another important consequence of the theory, which can betested experimentally, has to do with the path of rays of light.
In the general theory of relativity also the velocity of light is
everywhere the same, relatively to a local inertial system. This
velocity is unity in our natural measure of time. The law of
the propagation of light in general co-ordinates is therefore, ac-
cording to the general theory of relativity, characterized, by the
equationds2= 0.To within the approximation which we are using, and in the
system of co-ordinates which we have selected, the velocity of
light is characterized, according to(106), by the equation1 +κ4πZσ dV0r(dx12+dx22+dx32) =1 −κ4πZσ dV0rdl2.The velocity of lightL, is therefore expressed in our co-ordinatesbypdx12+dx22+dx32dl= 1 −κ4πZσ dV0r.(107)We can therefore draw the conclusion from this, that a ray of
light passing near a large mass is deflected. If we imagine the
sun, of massM concentrated at the origin of our system of co-ordinates, then a ray of light, travelling parallel to thex3-axis,in thex1-x3plane, at a distance ∆ from the origin, will bedeflected, in all, by an amountα =Z+∞−∞1L∂L∂x1dx3
THE GENERAL THEORY99towards the sun. On performing the integration we getα =κM2π∆.(108)The existence of this deflection, which amounts to 1.700for∆ equal to the radius of the sun, was confirmed, with remarkable
accuracy, by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition in 1919, and
most careful preparations have been made to get more exact
observational data at the solar eclipse in 1922. It should be
noted that this result, also, of the theory is not influenced by
our arbitrary choice of a system of co-ordinates.This is the place to speak of the third consequence of thetheory which can be tested by observation, namely, that which
concerns the motion of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. The
secular changes in the planetary orbits are known with such ac-
curacy that the approximation we have been using is no longer
sufficient for a comparison of theory and observation. It is nec-
essary to go back to the general field equations(96). To solvethis problem I made use of the method of successive approxima-
tions. Since then, however, the problem of the central symmet-
rical statical gravitational field has been completely solved by
Schwarzschild and others; the derivation given by H. Weyl in his
book, “Raum-Zeit-Materie,” is particularly elegant. The calcu-
lation can be simplified somewhat if we do not go back directly
to the equation(96), but base it upon a principle of variationthat is equivalent to this equation. I shall indicate the procedure
only in so far as is necessary for understanding the method.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY100In the case of a statical field,ds2must have the formds2= −dσ2+f2dx42,dσ2=X1–3γαβdxαdxβ,(109)where the summation on the right-hand side of the last equation
is to be extended over the space variables only. The central
symmetry of the field requires theγµνto be of the form,γαβ=µδαβ+λxαxβ;(110)f2,µ and λ are functions of r =√x12+x22+x32only. Oneof these three functions can be chosen arbitrarily, because our
system of co-ordinates is, a priori, completely arbitrary; for by
a substitutionx04=x4,x0α=F (r)xα,we can always insure that one of these three functions shall be
an assigned function ofr0. In place of(110)we can thereforeput, without limiting the generality,γαβ=δαβ+λxαxβ.(110a)In this way thegµνare expressed in terms of the two quan-titiesλ and f. These are to be determined as functions of r,by introducing them into equation(96), after first calculating

THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY102The calculation of the planetary motion depends upon equa-tion(90). From the first of equations(110b)and(90)we get,for the indices 1, 2, 3,ddsxαdxβds−xβdxαds= 0,or, if we integrate, and express the result in polar co-ordinates,r2dφds= constant.(111)From(90), forµ = 4, we get0 =d2lds2+1f2df2dxαdxαdsdlds=d2lds2+1f2df2dsdlds.From this, after multiplication byf2and integration, we havef2dlds= constant.(112)In(109c),(111)and(112)we have three equations betweenthe four variabless, r, l and φ, from which the motion of theplanet may be calculated in the same way as in classical me-
chanics. The most important result we get from this is a secular
rotation of the elliptic orbit of the planet in the same sense as
the revolution of the planet, amounting in radians per revolution

perihelion of the planet Mercury, which has been known for a
hundred years (since Leverrier), and for which theoretical as-
tronomy has hitherto been unable satisfactorily to account.There is no difficulty in expressing Maxwell’s theory of theelectromagnetic field in terms of the general theory of relativity;
this is done by application of the tensor formation(81),(82)and(77). Letφµbe a tensor of the first rank, to be denotedas an electromagnetic 4-potential; then an electromagnetic field
tensor may be defined by the relations,φµν=∂φµ∂xν−∂φν∂xµ.(114)The second of Maxwell’s systems of equations is then defined by
the tensor equation, resulting from this,∂φµν∂xρ+∂φνρ∂xµ+∂φρµ∂xν= 0,(114a)and the first of Maxwell’s systems of equations is defined by the
tensor-density relation∂ Fµν∂xν= Jµ,(115)
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY104in whichFµν=√−g gµνgντφστ,Jµ=√−g ρdxνds.If we introduce the energy tensor of the electromagnetic field
into the right-hand side of(96), we obtain(115), for the specialcase Jµ= 0, as a consequence of(96)by taking the divergence.This inclusion of the theory of electricity in the scheme of the
general theory of relativity has been considered arbitrary and
unsatisfactory by many theoreticians. Nor can we in this way
conceive of the equilibrium of the electricity which constitutes
the elementary electrically charged particles. A theory in which
the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field enter as an
essential entity would be much preferable. H. Weyl, and recently
Th. Kaluza, have discovered some ingenious theorems along this
direction; but concerning them, I am convinced that they do not
bring us nearer to the true solution of the fundamental problem.
I shall not go into this further, but shall give a brief discussion
of the so-called cosmological problem, for without this, the con-
siderations regarding the general theory of relativity would, in
a certain sense, remain unsatisfactory.Our previous considerations, based upon the field equa-tions(96), had for a foundation the conception that space onthe whole is Galilean-Euclidean, and that this character is dis-
turbed only by masses embedded in it. This conception was
certainly justified as long as we were dealing with spaces of the
order of magnitude of those that astronomy has to do with.
But whether portions of the universe, however large they may
be, are quasi-Euclidean, is a wholly different question. We can
THE GENERAL THEORY105make this clear by using an example from the theory of surfaces
which we have employed many times. If a portion of a surface
is observed by the eye to be practically plane, it does not at all
follow that the whole surface has the form of a plane; the surface
might just as well be a sphere, for example, of sufficiently large
radius. The question as to whether the universe as a whole is
non-Euclidean was much discussed from the geometrical point of
view before the development of the theory of relativity. But with
the theory of relativity, this problem has entered upon a new
stage, for according to this theory the geometrical properties of
bodies are not independent, but depend upon the distribution
of masses.If the universe were quasi-Euclidean, then Mach was whollywrong in his thought that inertia, as well as gravitation, depends
upon a kind of mutual action between bodies. For in this case,
with a suitably selected system of co-ordinates, thegµνwouldbe constant at infinity, as they are in the special theory of rela-
tivity, while within finite regions thegµνwould differ from theseconstant values by small amounts only, with a suitable choice
of co-ordinates, as a result of the influence of the masses in fi-
nite regions. The physical properties of space would not then be
wholly independent, that is, uninfluenced by matter, but in the
main they would be, and only in small measure, conditioned by
matter. Such a dualistic conception is even in itself not satis-
factory; there are, however, some important physical arguments
against it, which we shall consider.The hypothesis that the universe is infinite and Euclideanat infinity, is, from the relativistic point of view, a complicated
hypothesis. In the language of the general theory of relativity
it demands that the Riemann tensor of the fourth rankRiklm
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY106shall vanish at infinity, which furnishes twenty independent con-
ditions, while only ten curvature componentsRµν, enter intothe laws of the gravitational field. It is certainly unsatisfactory
to postulate such a far-reaching limitation without any physical
basis for it.But in the second place, the theory of relativity makes itappear probable that Mach was on the right road in his thought
that inertia depends upon a mutual action of matter. For we
shall show in the following that, according to our equations, inert
masses do act upon each other in the sense of the relativity of
inertia, even if only very feebly. What is to be expected along
the line of Mach’s thought?1. The inertia of a body must increase when ponderablemasses are piled up in its neighbourhood.2. A body must experience an accelerating force whenneighbouring masses are accelerated, and, in fact, the
force must be in the same direction as the acceleration.3. A rotating hollow body must generate inside of itselfa “Coriolis field,” which deflects moving bodies in the
sense of the rotation, and a radial centrifugal field as
well.We shall now show that these three effects, which are to beexpected in accordance with Mach’s ideas, are actually present
according to our theory, although their magnitude is so small
that confirmation of them by laboratory experiments is not to be
thought of. For this purpose we shall go back to the equations of
motion of a material particle(90), and carry the approximationssomewhat further than was done in equation(90a).
THE GENERAL THEORY107First, we considerγ44as small of the first order. The squareof the velocity of masses moving under the influence of the grav-
itational force is of the same order, according to the energy
equation. It is therefore logical to regard the velocities of the
material particles we are considering, as well as the velocities
of the masses which generate the field, as small, of the order12.We shall now carry out the approximation in the equations that
arise from the field equations(101)and the equations of mo-tion(90)so far as to consider terms, in the second memberof(90), that are linear in those velocities. Further, we shall notputds and dl equal to each other, but, corresponding to thehigher approximation, we shall putds =√g44dl =1 −γ442 dl.From(90)we obtain, at first,ddl1 +γ442dxµdl= −Γµ

The inert mass is proportional to 1 +σ, and thereforeincreases when ponderable masses approach the test
body.2. There is an inductive action of accelerated masses,of the same sign, upon the test body.This is theterm∂ A∂l.
THE GENERAL THEORY1093. A material particle, moving perpendicularly to the axisof rotation inside a rotating hollow body, is deflected in
the sense of the rotation (Coriolis field). The centrifu-
gal action, mentioned above, inside a rotating hollow
body, also follows from the theory, as has been shown
by Thirring.∗Although all of these effects are inaccessible to experiment,becauseκ is so small, nevertheless they certainly exist accord-ing to the general theory of relativity. We must see in them a
strong support for Mach’s ideas as to the relativity of all inertial
actions. If we think these ideas consistently through to the end
we must expect the whole inertia, that is, the wholegµν-field, tobe determined by the matter of the universe, and not mainly by
the boundary conditions at infinity.For a satisfactory conception of thegµν-field of cosmical di-mensions, the fact seems to be of significance that the relative
velocity of the stars is small compared to the velocity of light.
It follows from this that, with a suitable choice of co-ordinates,
g44is nearly constant in the universe, at least, in that part ofthe universe in which there is matter. The assumption appears
natural, moreover, that there are stars in all parts of the uni-
verse, so that we may well assume that the inconstancy ofg44de-pends only upon the circumstance that matter is not distributed
continuously, but is concentrated in single celestial bodies and
systems of bodies. If we are willing to ignore these more local∗That the centrifugal action must be inseparably connected with theexistence of the Coriolis field may be recognized, even without calculation,
in the special case of a co-ordinate system rotating uniformly relatively to
an inertial system; our general co-variant equations naturally must apply
to such a case.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY110non-uniformities of the density of matter and of thegµν-field, inorder to learn something of the geometrical properties of the uni-
verse as a whole, it appears natural to substitute for the actual
distribution of masses a continuous distribution, and further-
more to assign to this distribution a uniform densityσ. In thisimagined universe all points with space directions will be geo-
metrically equivalent; with respect to its space extension it will
have a constant curvature, and will be cylindrical with respect
to itsx4-co-ordinate. The possibility seems to be particularlysatisfying that the universe is spatially bounded and thus, in
accordance with our assumption of the constancy ofσ, is ofconstant curvature, being either spherical or elliptical; for then
the boundary conditions at infinity which are so inconvenient
from the standpoint of the general theory of relativity, may be
replaced by the much more natural conditions for a closed sur-
face.According to what has been said, we are to putds2=dx42−γµνdxµdxν,(119)in which the indicesµ and ν run from 1 to 3 only. The γµνwill be such functions ofx1,x2,x3as correspond to a three-dimensional continuum of constant positive curvature. We must
now investigate whether such an assumption can satisfy the field
equations of gravitation.In order to be able to investigate this, we must first findwhat differential conditions the three-dimensional manifold of

mensions, embedded in a Euclidean continuum of four dimen-
THE GENERAL THEORY111sions,∗is given by the equationsx12+x22+x32+x42=a2,dx12+dx22+dx32+dx42=ds2.By eliminatingx4, we getds2=dx12+dx22+dx32+(x1dx1+x2dx2+x3dx3)2a2−x12−x22−x32.As far as terms of the third and higher degrees in thexν, wecan put, in the neighbourhood of the origin of co-ordinates,ds2=δµν+xµxνa2 dxµdxν.Inside the brackets are thegµνof the manifold in the neigh-bourhood of the origin. Since the first derivatives of thegµν,and therefore also the Γσ
µν, vanish at the origin, the calculationof theRµνfor this manifold, by(88), is very simple at the origin.We haveRµν= −2a2δµν=2a2gµν.Since the relationRµν=2a2gµνis universally co-variant,and since all points of the manifold are geometrically equiva-
lent, this relation holds for every system of co-ordinates, and
everywhere in the manifold. In order to avoid confusion with∗The aid of a fourth space dimension has naturally no significance ex-cept that of a mathematical artifice.
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY112the four-dimensional continuum, we shall, in the following, des-
ignate quantities that refer to the three-dimensional continuum
by Greek letters, and putPµν= −2a2γµν.(120)We now proceed to apply the field equations(96)to our spe-cial case. From(119)we get for the four-dimensional manifold,Rµν= Pµνfor the indices 1 to 3,R14=R24=R34=R44= 0.)(121)For the right-hand side of(96)we have to consider the energytensor for matter distributed like a cloud of dust. According to
what has gone before we must therefore putTµν=σdxµdsdxνdsspecialized for the case of rest. But in addition, we shall add
a pressure term that may be physically established as follows.
Matter consists of electrically charged particles. On the basis
of Maxwell’s theory these cannot be conceived of as electro-
magnetic fields free from singularities. In order to be consistent
with the facts, it is necessary to introduce energy terms, not
contained in Maxwell’s theory, so that the single electric parti-
cles may hold together in spite of the mutual repulsions between
their elements, charged with electricity of one sign. For the sake
of consistency with this fact, Poincar´e has assumed a pressureto exist inside these particles which balances the electrostatic
repulsion. It cannot, however, be asserted that this pressure
THE GENERAL THEORY113vanishes outside the particles. We shall be consistent with this
circumstance if, in our phenomenological presentation, we add
a pressure term. This must not, however, be confused with a
hydrodynamical pressure, as it serves only for the energetic pre-
sentation of the dynamical relations inside matter. In this sense
we putTµν=gµσgνβdxαdsdxβds−gµνp.(122)In our special case we have, therefore, to putTµν=γµνp (for µ and ν from 1 to 3),T44=σ − p,T = −γµνγµνp + σ − p = σ − 4p.Observing that the field equation(96)may be written in theformRµν= −κ(Tµν−12gµνT ),we get from(96)the equations,+2a2γµν=κσ2−p γµν,0 = −κσ2+p .From this followsp = −σ2,a =r2κσ.(123)If the universe is quasi-Euclidean, and its radius of curvaturetherefore infinite, thenσ would vanish. But it is improbable that
THE MEANING OF RELATIVITY114the mean density of matter in the universe is actually zero; this
is our third argument against the assumption that the universe
is quasi-Euclidean. Nor does it seem possible that our hypothet-
ical pressure can vanish; the physical nature of this pressure can
be appreciated only after we have a better theoretical knowledge
of the electromagnetic field. According to the second of equa-
tions(123)the radius,a, of the universe is determined in termsof the total mass,M, of matter, by the equationa =Mκ4π2.(124)The complete dependence of the geometrical upon the physical
properties becomes clearly apparent by means of this equation.Thus we may present the following arguments against theconception of a space-infinite, and for the conception of a space-
bounded, universe:—1. From the standpoint of the theory of relativity, the con-dition for a closed surface is very much simpler than the corre-
sponding boundary condition at infinity of the quasi-Euclidean
structure of the universe.2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends uponthe mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approx-
imation, in the equations of the theory of relativity; it follows
from these equations that inertia depends, at least in part, upon
mutual actions between masses. As it is an unsatisfactory as-
sumption to make that inertia depends in part upon mutual
actions, and in part upon an independent property of space,
Mach’s idea gains in probability. But this idea of Mach’s corre-
sponds only to a finite universe, bounded in space, and not to a
quasi-Euclidean, infinite universe. From the standpoint of epis-
THE GENERAL THEORY115temology it is more satisfying to have the mechanical properties
of space completely determined by matter, and this is the case
only in a space-bounded universe.3. An infinite universe is possible only if the mean density ofmatter in the universe vanishes. Although such an assumption
is logically possible, it is less probable than the assumption that
there is a finite mean density of matter in the universe.

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.It existsbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
LICENSINGapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donateSection 5.General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
