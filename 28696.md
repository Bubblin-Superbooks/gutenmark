PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

The chief alterations, since the First Edition, have been made in the Chapter on ‘Classification’. The chief additions have been the questions on words and phrases, added to the Examination-Papers at , and the Notes inserted at the end.

In Book I, Chapter II, I have adopted a new definition of ‘Classification’, which enables me to regard the whole Universe as a ‘Class,’ and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase ‘a Set of Things.’

In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Existence’ I have adopted a new ‘normal form,’ in which the Class, whose existence is affirmed or denied, is regarded as the _Predicate_, instead of the _Subject_, of the Proposition, thus evading a very subtle difficulty which besets the other form. These subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every Tree of Knowledge, and they are _far_ more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches. For example, the difficulties of the Forty-Seventh Proposition of Euclid are mere child’s play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight Line. And, in the present work, the difficulties of the “5 Liars” Problem, at , are “trifles, light as air,” compared with the bewildering question “What is a Thing?”

In the Chapter on ‘Propositions of Relation’ I have inserted a new Section, containing the proof that a Proposition, beginning with “All,” is a _Double_ Proposition (a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule, laid down in the next Section, that such a Proposition is to be understood as implying the actual _existence_ of its Subject). This proof was given, in the earlier editions, incidentally, in the course of the discussion of the Biliteral Diagram: but its _proper_ place, in this treatise, is where I have now introduced it.

In the Sorites-Examples, I have made a good many verbal alterations, in order to evade a difficulty, which I fear will have perplexed some of the Readers of the first three Editions. Some of the Premisses were so worded that their Terms were not Specieses of the Univ. named in the Dictionary, but of a larger Class, of which the Univ. was only a portion. In all such cases, it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger Class was thereby asserted of the Univ., and should ignore, as superfluous, all that it asserted of its _other_ portion. Thus, in Ex. 15, the Univ. was stated to be “ducks in this village,” and the third Premiss was “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks,” i.e. “No gray ducks are ducks belonging to Mrs. Bond.” Here the Terms are _not_ Specieses of the Univ., but of the larger Class “ducks,” of which the Univ. is only a portion: and it was intended that the Reader should perceive that what is here asserted of “ ducks” is thereby asserted of “ ducks in this village.” and should treat this Premiss as if it were “Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks in this village,” and should ignore, as superfluous, what it asserts as to the _other_ portion of the Class “ducks,” viz. “ Mrs. Bond has no gray ducks _out of_ this village”.

In the Appendix I have given a new version of the Problem of the “Five Liars.” My object, in doing so, is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a Proposition as being its own Subject, or a Set of Propositions as being Subjects for one another. It is certainly, a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory: one cannot help feeling that there is a great lack of _substance_ in all this shadowy host——that, as the procession of phantoms glides before us, there is not _one_ that we can pounce upon, and say “_Here_ is a Proposition that _must_ be either true or false!”——that it is but a Barmecide Feast, to which we have been bidden——and that its prototype is to be found in that mythical island, whose inhabitants “earned a precarious living by taking in each others’ washing”! By simply translating “telling 2 Truths” into “taking _both_ of 2 condiments (salt and mustard),” “telling 2 Lies” into “taking _neither_ of them” and “telling a Truth and a Lie (order not specified)” into “taking only _one_ condiment (it is not specified _which_),” I have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles, and have produced a Problem which, when translated into a Set of symbolized Premisses, furnishes the very same _Data_ as were furnished by the Problem of the “Five Liars.”

The coined words, introduced in previous editions, such as “Eliminands” and “Retinends”, perhaps hardly need any apology: they were indispensable to my system: but the new plural, here used for the first time, viz. “Soriteses”, will, I fear, be condemned as “bad English”, unless I say a word in its defence. We have _three_ singular nouns, in English, of plural _form_, “series”, “species”, and “Sorites”: in all three, the awkwardness, of using the same word for both singular and plural, must often have been felt: this has been remedied, in the case of “series” by coining the plural “serieses”, which has already found it way into the dictionaries: so I am no rash innovator, but am merely “following suit”, in using the new plural “Soriteses”.

In conclusion, let me point out that even those, who are obliged to study _Formal_ Logic, with a view to being able to answer Examination-Papers in that subject, will find the study of _Symbolic_ Logic most helpful for this purpose, in throwing light upon many of the obscurities with which Formal Logic abounds, and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of _testing_ the results arrived at by the cumbrous processes which Formal Logic enforces upon its votaries.

This is, I believe, the very first attempt (with the exception of my own little book, _The Game of Logic_, published in 1886, a very incomplete performance that has been made to _popularise_ this fascinating subject. It has cost me _years_ of hard work: but if it should prove, as I hope it may, to be of _real_ service to the young, and to be taken up, in High Schools and in private families, as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental recreations, such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that I have expended on it.

INTRODUCTION.

---

#### _TO LEARNERS._

The Learner, who wishes to try the question _fairly_, whether this little book does, or does not, supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation, is _earnestly_ advised to adopt the following Rules:—

 Begin at the _beginning_, and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book, here and there. This would very likely lead to your throwing it aside, with the remark “This is _much_ too hard for me!”, and thus losing the chance of adding a very _large_ item to your stock of mental delights. This Rule (of not _dipping_ is very _desirable_ with _other_ kinds of books——such as novels, for instance, where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story, by dipping into it further on, so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of looking into Vol. III first, just to see how the story ends: and perhaps it _is_ as well just to know that all ends _happily_——that the much-persecuted lovers _do_ marry after all, that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is completely foiled in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (_Qu._ Why in _India_? _Ans._ Because, somehow, uncles never _can_ get rich anywhere else dies at exactly the right moment——before taking the trouble to read Vol. I. This, I say, is _just_ permissible with a _novel_, where Vol. III has a _meaning_, even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story; but, with a _scientific_ book, it is sheer insanity: you will find the latter part _hopelessly_ unintelligible, if you read it before reaching it in regular course.

 Don’t begin any fresh Chapter, or Section, until you are certain that you _thoroughly_ understand the whole book _up to that point_, and that you have worked, correctly, most if not all of the examples which have been set. So long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely _conquered_, and that you are leaving no unsolved difficulties _behind_ you, which will be sure to turn up again later on, your triumphal progress will be easy and delightful. Otherwise, you will find your state of puzzlement get worse and worse as you proceed, till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust.  

 When you come to any passage you don’t understand, _read it again_: if you _still_ don’t understand it, _read it again_: if you fail, even after _three_ readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is _quite_ easy. 

 If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you. _Talking_ is a wonderful smoother-over of difficulties. When _I_ come upon anything——in Logic or in any other hard subject——that entirely puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, _aloud_, even when I am all alone. One can explain things so _clearly_ to one’s self! And then, you know, one is so _patient_ with one’s self: one _never_ gets irritated at one’s own stupidity!  

If, dear Reader, you will faithfully observe these Rules, and so give my little book a really _fair_ trial, I promise you, most confidently, that you will find Symbolic Logic to be one of the most, if not _the_ most, fascinating of mental recreations! In this First Part, I have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of (say twelve or fourteen years of age. I have myself taught most of its contents, _vivâ voce_, to _many_ children, and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject. For those, who succeed in mastering Part I, and who begin, like Oliver, “asking for more,” I hope to provide, in Part II, some _tolerably_ hard nuts to crack——nuts that will require all the nut-crackers they happen to possess!

Mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health; and you may get much healthy enjoyment, no doubt, from Games, such as Back-gammon, Chess, and the new Game “Halma”. But, after all, when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these Games, you have nothing real to _show_ for it, as a _result!_ You enjoyed the Game, and the victory, no doubt, _at the time_: but you have no _result_ that you can treasure up and get real _good_ out of. And, all the while, you have been leaving unexplored a perfect _mine_ of wealth. Once master the machinery of Symbolic Logic, and you have a mental occupation always at hand, of absorbing interest, and one that will be of real _use_ to you in _any_ subject you may take up. It will give you clearness of thought——the ability to _see your way_ through a puzzle——the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and get-at-able form——and, more valuable than all, the power to detect _fallacies_, and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments, which you will so continually encounter in books, in newspapers, in speeches, and even in sermons, and which so easily delude those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating Art. 

_Try it._ 

That is all I ask of you!

\–L. C.

#### THINGS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES.

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _INTRODUCTORY._

The Universe contains ‘Things.’

> For example, “I,” “London,” “roses,” “redness,” “old English books,” “the letter which I received yesterday.”

Things have ‘Attributes.’

> For example, “large,” “red,” “old,” “which I received yesterday.”

One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many Things.

> Thus, the Thing “a rose” may have the Attributes “red,” “scented,” “full-blown,” &c.; and the Attribute “red” may belong to the Things “a rose,” “a brick,” “a ribbon,” &c.

Any Attribute, or any Set of Attributes, may be called an ‘Adjunct.’

> This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant repetition of the phrase “Attribute or Set of Attributes.”
> Thus, we may say that a rose has the Attribute “red” (or the Adjunct “red,” whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has the Adjunct “red, scented and full-blown.”
---

#### ½CHAPTER II.

##### _CLASSIFICATION._

‘Classification,’ or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things. Such a group is called a ‘Class.’

This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:—

  We may imagine that we have put together all Things. The Class so formed (i.e. the Class “Things” contains the whole Universe.

  We may think of the Class “Things,” and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be ‘peculiar’ to the Class so formed. In this case, the Class “Things” is called a ‘Genus’ with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is called a ‘Species’ of the Class “Things”: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its ‘Differentia’.

As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there _is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If there _is_, the Class is said to be ‘Real’; if not, it is said to be ‘Unreal’, or ‘Imaginary.’

> For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the Class “Things,” all the Things which possess the Adjunct “material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets”; and we may thus form the Real Class “towns.” Here we may regard “Things” as a _Genus_, “Towns” as a _Species_ of Things, and “material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets” as its _Differentia_.
> Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things which possess the Adjunct “weighing a ton, easily lifted by a baby”; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class “Things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby.”
-  We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class “Things,” and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be ‘peculiar’ to the smaller Class so formed. In this case, the Class thought of is called a ‘Genus’ with regard to the smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a ‘Species’ of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its ‘Differentia’.

> For example, we may think of the Class “towns,” and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the Attribute “lit with gas”; and we may thus form the Real Class “towns lit with gas.” Here we may regard “Towns” as a _Genus_, “Towns lit with gas” as a _Species_ of Towns, and “lit with gas” as its _Differentia_.
> If, in the above example, we were to alter “lit with gas” into “paved with gold,” we should get the _Imaginary_ Class “towns paved with gold.”

A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an ‘Individual.’

> For example, the Class “towns having four million inhabitants,” which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz. “London.”
½Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.

> Thus “London” may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked out from the Class “towns,” which has, as its Differentia, “having four million inhabitants.”

A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one single Thing_. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.

> Thus, the Class “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment,” when regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute “formed in square,” which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.
---

#### CHAPTER III.

##### _DIVISION._

###### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

‘Division’ is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller Classes.

> Thus, we might think of the Class “books,” and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller Classes “bound books” and “unbound books,” or into the three Classes, “books priced at less than a shilling,” “shilling-books,” “books priced at more than a shilling,” or into the twenty-six Classes, “books whose names begin with _A_,” “books whose names begin with _B_,” &c.

A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be ‘codivisional’ with every Class obtained by that Division.

> Thus, the Class “bound books” is codivisional with each of the two Classes, “bound books” and “unbound books.”
> Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been “contemporary” with every event that happened in 1815.

Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.

> Thus, the Class “bound books” is codivisional with itself.
> Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been “contemporary” with itself.
##### ½§ 2.

###### _Dichotomy._

If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class. Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the word “not”; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiæ are _contradictory_. This kind of Division is called ‘Dichotomy’.

> For example, we may divide “books” into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “old” and “not-old.”

In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and _which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the other begin.

> Thus, in dividing “books” into “old” and “not-old,” we may say “Let all books printed before a.d. 1801, be regarded as ‘old,’ and all others as ‘not-old’.”

Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided into two Classes, whose Differentiæ have contrary meanings, each Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word “not” prefixed.

> Thus, if “books” be divided into “old” and “new” the Attribute “old” is to be regarded as equivalent to “not-new,” and the Attribute “new” as equivalent to “not-old.”

After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes; and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of Classes being doubled at each repetition.

> For example, we may divide “books” into “old” and “new” (i.e. “_not_\-old”): we may then sub-divide each of these into “English” and “foreign” (i.e. “_not_\-English”), thus getting _four_ Classes, viz.
  old English;

  old foreign;

  new English;

  new foreign.

> If we had begun by dividing into “English” and “foreign,” and had then sub-divided into “old” and “new,” the four Classes would have been
  English old;

  English new;

  foreign old;

  foreign new.

> The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four Classes which we had before.
---

#### ½CHAPTER IV.

##### _NAMES._

The word “Thing”, which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing. Any other word (or phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_.

Such a word (or phrase is called a ‘Name’; and, if there be an existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that Thing.

> For example, the words “Thing,” “Treasure,” “Town,” and the phrases “valuable Thing,” “material artificial Thing consisting of houses and streets,” “Town lit with gas,” “Town paved with gold,” “old English Book.”

Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing represented by it.

> Thus, “Town lit with gas” is a _Real_ Name: “Town paved with gold” is an _Unreal_ Name.

Every Name is either a Substantive only, or else a phrase consisting of a Substantive and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives).

Every Name, except “Thing”, may usually be expressed in three different forms:—

_a_ The Substantive “Thing”, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives conveying the ideas of the Attributes;

_b_ A Substantive, conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _some_ of the Attributes, and one or more Adjectives (or phrases used as Adjectives conveying the ideas of the _other_ Attributes;

_c_ A Substantive conveying the idea of a Thing with the ideas of _all_ the Attributes.

> Thus, the phrase “material living Thing, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet” is a Name expressed in Form (_a_).
> If we choose to roll up together the Substantive “Thing” and the Adjectives “material, living, belonging to the Animal Kingdom,” so as to make the new Substantive “Animal,” we get the phrase “Animal having two hands and two feet,” which is a Name (representing the same Thing as before expressed in Form (_b_).
> And, if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word, so as to make the new Substantive “Man,” we get a Name (still representing the very same Thing expressed in Form (_c_).

A Name, whose Substantive is in the _plural_ number, may be used to represent either

  Members of a Class, _regarded as separate Things_;

or (2 a whole Class, _regarded as one single Thing_.

> Thus, when I say “Some soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are tall,” or “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are brave,” I am using the Name “soldiers of the Tenth Regiment” in the _first_ sense; and it is just the same as if I were to point to each of them _separately_, and to say “_This_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall,” “_That_ soldier of the Tenth Regiment is tall,” and so on.
> But, when I say “The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment are formed in square,” I am using the phrase in the _second_ sense; and it is just the same as if I were to say “The _Tenth Regiment_ is formed in square.”
---

#### CHAPTER V.

##### _DEFINITIONS._

It is evident that every Member of a _Species_ is _also_ a Member of the _Genus_ out of which that Species has been picked, and that it possesses the _Differentia_ of that Species. Hence it may be represented by a Name consisting of two parts, one being a Name representing any Member of the _Genus_, and the other being the _Differentia_ of that Species. Such a Name is called a ‘Definition’ of any Member of that Species, and to give it such a Name is to ‘define’ it.

> Thus, we may define a “Treasure” as a “valuable Thing.” In this case we regard “Things” as the _Genus_, and “valuable” as the _Differentia_.

The following Examples, of this Process, may be taken as models for working others.

> Note that, in each Definition, the Substantive, representing a Member (or Members of the _Genus_, is printed in Capitals.
\. Define “a Treasure.”

_Ans._ “a valuable Thing.”

\. Define “Treasures.”

_Ans._ “valuable Things.”

\. Define “a Town.”

_Ans._ “a material artificial Thing, consisting of houses and streets.”

\. Define “Men.”

_Ans._ “material, living Things, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, having two hands and two feet”;

or else

“Animals having two hands and two feet.”

\. Define “London.”

_Ans._ “the material artificial Thing, which consists of houses and streets, and has four million inhabitants”;

or else

“the Town which has four million inhabitants.”

> Note that we here use the article “the” instead of “a”, because we happen to know that there is only _one_ such Thing.
> The Reader can set himself any number of Examples of this Process, by simply choosing the Name of any common Thing (such as “house,” “tree,” “knife”), making a Definition for it, and then testing his answer by referring to any English Dictionary.
### BOOK II.

---

#### PROPOSITIONS.

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _PROPOSITIONS GENERALLY._

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

Note that the word “some” is to be regarded, henceforward, as meaning “one or more.”

The word ‘Proposition,’ as used in ordinary conversation, may be applied to _any_ word, or phrase, which conveys any information whatever.

> Thus the words “yes” and “no” are Propositions in the ordinary sense of the word; and so are the phrases “you owe me five farthings” and “I don’t!”
> Such words as “oh!” or “never!”, and such phrases as “fetch me that book!” “which book do you mean?” do not seem, at first sight, to convey any _information_; but they can easily be turned into equivalent forms which do so, viz. “I am surprised,” “I will never consent to it,” “I order you to fetch me that book,” “I want to know which book you mean.”

But a ‘Proposition,’ as used in this First Part of “Symbolic Logic,” has a peculiar form, which may be called its ‘Normal

form’; and if any Proposition, which we wish to use in an argument, is not in normal form, we must reduce it to such a form, before we can use it.

A ‘Proposition,’ when in normal form, asserts, as to certain two Classes, which are called its ‘Subject’ and ‘Predicate,’ either

    (1 that _some_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate;

or (2 that _no_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate;

or (3 that _all_ Members of its Subject are Members of its Predicate.

The Subject and the Predicate of a Proposition are called its ‘Terms.’

Two Propositions, which convey the _same_ information, are said to be ‘equivalent’.

> Thus, the two Propositions, “I see John” and “John is seen by me,” are equivalent.
##### § 2.

###### _Normal form of a Proposition._

A Proposition, in normal form, consists of four parts, viz.—

  The word “some,” or “no,” or “all.” (This word, which tells us _how many_ Members of the Subject are also Members of the Predicate, is called the ‘Sign of Quantity.’

  Name of Subject.

  The verb “are” (or “is”). (This is called the ‘Copula.’

  Name of Predicate.

##### § 3.

###### _Various kinds of Propositions._

A Proposition, that begins with “Some”, is said to be ‘Particular.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in I.’

> Note, that it is called ‘Particular,’ because it refers to a _part_ only of the Subject.

A Proposition, that begins with “No”, is said to be ‘Universal Negative.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in E.’

A Proposition, that begins with “All”, is said to be ‘Universal Affirmative.’ It is also called ‘a Proposition in A.’

> Note, that they are called ‘Universal’, because they refer to the _whole_ of the Subject.

A Proposition, whose Subject is an _Individual_, is to be regarded as _Universal_.

> Let us take, as an example, the Proposition “John is not well”. This of course implies that there is an _Individual_, to whom the speaker refers when he mentions “John”, and whom the listener _knows_ to be referred to. Hence the Class “men referred to by the speaker when he mentions ‘John’” is a one-Member Class, and the Proposition is equivalent to “_All_ the men, who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions ‘John’, are not well.”

Propositions are of two kinds, ‘Propositions of Existence’ and ‘Propositions of Relation.’

These shall be discussed separately.

---

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _PROPOSITIONS OF EXISTENCE._

A ‘Proposition of Existence’, when in normal form, has, for its _Subject_, the Class “existing Things”.

Its Sign of Quantity is “Some” or “No”.

> Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ existing Things are Members of its Predicate, it does _not_ tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _two_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, “0” and “1 or more.”

It is called “a Proposition of Existence” because its effect is to assert the _Reality_ (i.e. the real _existence_), or else the _Imaginariness_, of its Predicate.

> Thus, the Proposition “Some existing Things are honest men” asserts that the Class “honest men” is _Real_.
> This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:—
  “Honest men exist”;

  “Some honest men exist”;

  “The Class ‘honest men’ exists”;

  “There are honest men”;

  “There are some honest men”.

> Similarly, the Proposition “No existing Things are men fifty feet high” asserts that the Class “men 50 feet high” is _Imaginary_.
> This is the _normal_ form; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms:—
  “Men 50 feet high do not exist”;

  “No men 50 feet high exist”;

  “The Class ‘men 50 feet high’ does not exist”;

  “There are not any men 50 feet high”;

  “There are no men 50 feet high.”

---

#### CHAPTER III.

##### _PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

A Proposition of Relation, of the kind to be here discussed, has, for its Terms, two Specieses of the same Genus, such that each of the two Names conveys the idea of some Attribute _not_ conveyed by the other.

> Thus, the Proposition “Some merchants are misers” is of the right kind, since “merchants” and “misers” are Specieses of the same Genus “men”; and since the Name “merchants” conveys the idea of the Attribute “mercantile”, and the name “misers” the idea of the Attribute “miserly”, each of which ideas is _not_ conveyed by the other Name.
> But the Proposition “Some dogs are setters” is _not_ of the right kind, since, although it is true that “dogs” and “setters” are Specieses of the same Genus “animals”, it is _not_ true that the Name “dogs” conveys the idea of any Attribute not conveyed by the Name “setters”. Such Propositions will be discussed in Part II.

The Genus, of which the two Terms are Specieses, is called the ‘Universe of Discourse,’ or (more briefly the ‘Univ.’

The Sign of Quantity is “Some” or “No” or “All”.

> Note that, though its Sign of Quantity tells us _how many_ Members of its Subject are _also_ Members of its Predicate, it does not tell us the _exact_ number: in fact, it only deals with _three_ numbers, which are, in ascending order, “0”, “1 or more”, “the total number of Members of the Subject”.

It is called “a Proposition of Relation” because its effect is to assert that a certain _relationship_ exists between its Terms.

##### § 2.

###### _Reduction of a Proposition of Relation to Normal form._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—

  Ascertain what is the _Subject_ (i.e., ascertain what Class we are _talking about_);

  If the verb, governed by the Subject, is _not_ the verb “are” (or “is”), substitute for it a phrase beginning with “are” (or “is”);

  Ascertain what is the _Predicate_ (i.e., ascertain what Class it is, which is asserted to contain _some_, or _none_, or _all_, of the Members of the Subject);

  If the Name of each Term is _completely expressed_ (i.e. if it contains a Substantive), there is no need to determine the ‘Univ.’; but, if either Name is _incompletely expressed_, and contains _Attributes_ only, it is then necessary to determine a ‘Univ.’, in order to insert its Name as the Substantive.

  Ascertain the _Sign of Quantity_;

  Arrange in the following order:—

Sign of Quantity,  
Subject,  
Copula,  
Predicate.  

> Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
> “Some apples are not ripe.”
  The Subject is “apples.”

  The Verb is “are.”

  The Predicate is “not-ripe \ \ \.” (As no Substantive is expressed, and we have not yet settled what the Univ. is to be, we are forced to leave a blank.

  Let Univ. be “fruit.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “some.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “Some | apples | are | not-ripe fruit.”
> “None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
  The Subject is “my speculations.”

  The Verb is “have brought,” for which we substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ that have brought”.

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ that have brought &c.”

  Let Univ. be “transactions.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “none of.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “None of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
> “None but the brave deserve the fair.”
> To begin with, we note that the phrase “none but the brave” is equivalent to “no _not_\-brave.”
  The Subject has for its _Attribute_ “not-brave.” But no _Substantive_ is supplied. So we express the Subject as “not-brave \ \ \.”

  The Verb is “deserve,” for which we substitute the phrase “are deserving of”.

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ deserving of the fair.”

  Let Univ. be “persons.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair.”
> “A lame puppy would not say “thank you” if you offered to lend it a skipping-rope.”
  The Subject is evidently “lame puppies,” and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the Predicate.

  The Verb is “would not say,” &c., for which we may substitute the phrase “are not grateful for.”

  The Predicate may be expressed as “\ \ \ not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”

  Let Univ. be “puppies.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “All | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the loan of a skipping-rope.”
> “No one takes in the _Times_, unless he is well-educated.”
  The Subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated (“no _one_” evidently means “no _person_”).

  The Verb is “takes in,” for which we may substitute the phrase “are persons taking in.”

  The Predicate is “persons taking in the _Times_.”

  Let Univ. be “persons.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “No | persons who are not well-educated | are | persons taking in the _Times_.”
> “My carriage will meet you at the station.”
  The Subject is “my carriage.” This, being an ‘Individual,’ is equivalent to the Class “my carriages.” (Note that this Class contains only _one_ Member.

  The Verb is “will meet”, for which we may substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ that will meet.”

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ that will meet you at the station.”

  Let Univ. be “things.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “All | my carriages | are | things that will meet you at the station.”
> “Happy is the man who does not know what ‘toothache’ means!”
  The Subject is evidently “the man &c.” (Note that in this sentence, the _Predicate_ comes first. At first sight, the Subject seems to be an ‘_Individual_’; but on further consideration, we see that the article “the” does _not_ imply that there is only _one_ such man. Hence the phrase “the man who” is equivalent to “all men who”.

  The Verb is “are.”

  The Predicate is “happy \ \ \.”

  Let Univ. be “men.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “All | men who do not know what ‘toothache’ means | are | happy men.”
> “Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
  The Subject is “farmers.”

  The Verb is “grumble,” for which we substitute the phrase “are \ \ \ who grumble.”

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ who always grumble &c.”

  Let Univ. be “persons.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “some.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “Some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
> “No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.”
  The Subject is “lambs.”

  The Verb is “are.”

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ accustomed &c.”

  Let Univ. be “animals.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “no.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “No | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars.”
> “I ca’n’t understand examples that are not arranged in regular order, like those I am used to.”
  The Subject is “examples that,” &c.

  The Verb is “I ca’n’t understand,” which we must alter, so as to have “examples,” instead of “I,” as the nominative case. It may be expressed as “are not understood by me.”

  The Predicate is “\ \ \ not understood by me.”

  Let Univ. be “examples.”

  The Sign of Quantity is “all.”

  The Proposition now becomes

> “All | examples that are not arranged in regular order like those I am used to | are | examples not understood by me.”
##### § 3.

###### _A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a Double Proposition._

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, asserts (as we already know that “_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”. This evidently contains, as a _part_ of what it tells us, the smaller Proposition “_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”.

> Thus, the Proposition “_All_ bankers are rich men” evidently contains the smaller Proposition “_Some_ bankers are rich men”.

The question now arises “What is the _rest_ of the information which this Proposition gives us?”

In order to answer this question, let us begin with the smaller Proposition, “_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate,” and suppose that this is _all_ we have been told; and let us proceed to inquire what _else_ we need to be told, in order to know that “_All_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”.

> Thus, we may suppose that the Proposition “_Some_ bankers are rich men” is all the information we possess; and we may proceed to inquire what _other_ Proposition needs to be added to it, in order to make up the entire Proposition “_All_ bankers are rich men”.

Let us also suppose that the ‘Univ.’ (i.e. the Genus, of which both the Subject and the Predicate are Specieses has been divided (by the Process of _Dichotomy_ into two smaller Classes, viz.

  the Predicate;

  the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate.

> Thus, we may suppose that the Genus “men,” (of which both “bankers” and “rich men” are Specieses has been divided into the two smaller Classes, “rich men”, “poor men”.

Now we know that _every_ Member of the Subject is (as shown at  p. 6 a Member of the Univ. Hence _every_ Member of the Subject is either in Class (1 or else in Class (2).

> Thus, we know that _every_ banker is a Member of the Genus “men”. Hence, _every_ banker is either in the Class “rich men”, or else in the Class “poor men”.

Also we have been told that, in the case we are discussing, _some_ Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What _else_ do we need to be told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that _none_ of them are in Class (2); i.e. that _none_ of them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate.

> Thus, we may suppose we have been told that _some_ bankers are in the Class “rich men”. What _else_ do we need to be told, in order to know that _all_ of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that _none_ of them are in the Class “_poor_ men”.

Hence a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is a _Double_ Proposition, and is ‘equivalent’ to (i.e. gives the same information as the _two_ Propositions

  “_Some_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Predicate”;

  “_No_ Members of the Subject are Members of the Class whose Differentia is _contradictory_ to that of the Predicate”.

> Thus, the Proposition “_All_ bankers are rich men” is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions
  “_Some_ bankers are rich men”;

  “_No_ bankers are _poor_ men”.

##### § 4.

###### _What is implied, in a Proposition of Relation, as to the Reality of its Terms?_

Note that the rules, here laid down, are _arbitrary_, and only apply to Part I of my “Symbolic Logic.”

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some”, is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _some existing Things_, which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _some existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.

> Thus, the Proposition “Some rich men are invalids” is to be understood as asserting that _some existing Things_ are “rich invalids”. Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, “rich men” and “invalids”, taken by itself, is _Real_.

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “No”, is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are _no existing Things_ which, being Members of the Subject, are also Members of the Predicate; i.e. that _no existing Things_ are Members of _both_ Terms at once. But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_ of either Term taken by itself.

> Thus, the Proposition “No mermaids are milliners” is to be understood as asserting that _no existing Things_ are “mermaid-milliners”. But this implies nothing as to the _Reality_, or the _Unreality_, of either of the two Classes, “mermaids” and “milliners”, taken by itself. In this case as it happens, the Subject is _Imaginary_, and the Predicate _Real_.

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, contains (see  § 3 a similar Proposition beginning with “Some”. Hence it is to be understood as implying that _each_ Term, taken by itself, is _Real_.

> Thus, the Proposition “All hyænas are savage animals” contains the Proposition “Some hyænas are savage animals”. Hence it implies that _each_ of the two Classes, “hyænas” and “savage animals”, taken by itself, is _Real_.
##### § 5.

###### _Translation of a Proposition of Relation into one or more Propositions of Existence._

We have seen that a Proposition of Relation, beginning with “Some,” asserts that _some existing Things_, being Members of its Subject, are _also_ Members of its Predicate. Hence, it asserts that some existing Things are Members of _both_; i.e. it asserts that some existing Things are Members of the Class of Things which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate.

Hence, to translate it into a Proposition of Existence, we take “existing Things” as the new _Subject_, and Things, which have _all_ the Attributes of the Subject and the Predicate, as the new Predicate.

Similarly for a Proposition of Relation beginning with “No”.

A Proposition of Relation, beginning with “All”, is (as shown in  § 3 equivalent to _two_ Propositions, one beginning with “Some” and the other with “No”, each of which we now know how to translate.

> Let us work a few Examples, to illustrate these Rules.
> “Some apples are not ripe.”
> Here we arrange thus:—
> “Some”
>    
> _Sign of Quantity_.
> “existing Things”
>    
> _Subject_.
> “are”
>    
> _Copula_.
> “not-ripe apples”
>    
> _Predicate_.
> or thus:—
> “Some | existing Things | are | not-ripe apples.”
> “Some farmers always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
> Here we arrange thus:—
> “Some | existing Things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather, whatever it may be.”
> “No lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars.”
> Here we arrange thus:—
> “No | existing Things |are | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars.”
> “None of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
> Here we arrange thus:—
> “No | existing Things | are | speculations of mine, which have brought me as much as 5 per cent.”
> “None but the brave deserve the fair.”
> Here we note, to begin with, that the phrase “none but the brave” is equivalent to “no not-brave men.” We then arrange thus:—
> “No | existing Things | are | not-brave men deserving of the fair.”
> “All bankers are rich men.”
> This is equivalent to the two Propositions “Some bankers are rich men” and “No bankers are poor men.”
> Here we arrange thus:—
> “Some | existing Things | are | rich bankers”; and “No | existing Things | are | poor bankers.”

### BOOK III.

---

#### THE BILITERAL DIAGRAM.

![An annotated biliteral diagram](images/b3c1d01.png)

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _SYMBOLS AND CELLS._

First, let us suppose that the above Diagram is an enclosure assigned to a certain Class of Things, which we have selected as our ‘Universe of Discourse.’ or, more briefly, as our ‘Univ’.

> For example, we might say “Let Univ. be ‘books’”; and we might imagine the Diagram to be a large table, assigned to all “books.”
> The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_ to refer to the above Diagram, but to draw a large one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it, about which he is reading.

Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call “_x_,” and have divided the large Class, to which we have assigned the whole Diagram, into the two smaller Classes whose Differentiæ are “_x_” and “not-_x_” (which we may call “_x′_”), and that we have assigned the _North_ Half of the Diagram to the one (which we may call “the Class of _x_\-Things,” or “the _x_\-Class”), and the _South_ Half to the other (which we may call “the Class of _x′_\-Things,” or “the _x′_\-Class”).

> For example, we might say “Let _x_ mean ‘old,’ so that _x′_ will mean ‘new’,” and we might suppose that we had divided books into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “old” and “new,” and had assigned the _North_ Half of the table to “_old_ books” and the _South_ Half to “_new_ books.”

Thirdly, let us suppose that we have selected another Adjunct, which we may call “_y_”, and have subdivided the _x_\-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “_y_” and “_y′_”, and that we have assigned the North-_West_ Cell to the one (which we may call “the _x_y_\-Class”), and the North-_East_ Cell to the other (which we may call “the _x_y′_\-Class”).

> For example, we might say “Let _y_ mean ‘English,’ so that _y′_ will mean ‘foreign’”, and we might suppose that we had subdivided “old books” into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are “English” and “foreign”, and had assigned the North-_West_ Cell to “old _English_ books”, and the North-_East_ Cell to “old _foreign_ books.”

Fourthly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the _x′_\-Class in the same manner, and have assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the _x′_y_\-Class, and the South-_East_ Cell to the _x′_y′_\-Class.

> For example, we might suppose that we had subdivided “new books” into the two Classes “new _English_ books” and “new _foreign_ books”, and had assigned the South-_West_ Cell to the one, and the South-_East_ Cell to the other.

It is evident that, if we had begun by dividing for _y_ and _y′_, and had then subdivided for _x_ and _x′_, we should have got the _same_ four Classes. Hence we see that we have assigned the _West_ Half to the _y_\-Class, and the _East_ Half to the _y′_\-Class.

![Diagram representing books](images/b3c1d02.png)
> Thus, in the above Example, we should find that we had assigned the _West_ Half of the table to “_English_ books” and the _East_ Half to “_foreign_ books.”  
>  
> We have, in fact, assigned the four Quarters of the table to four different Classes of books, as here shown.

The Reader should carefully remember that, in such a phrase as “the x-Things,” the word “Things” means that particular _kind_ of Things, to which the whole Diagram has been assigned.

> Thus, if we say “Let Univ. be ‘books’,” we mean that we have assigned the whole Diagram to “books.” In that case, if we took “_x_” to mean “old”, the phrase “the _x_\-Things” would mean “the old books.”

The Reader should not go on to the next Chapter until he is _quite familiar_ with the _blank_ Diagram I have advised him to draw.

He ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Adjunct_ assigned to any Compartment named in the right-hand column of the following Table.

Also he ought to be able to name, _instantly_, the _Compartment_ assigned to any Adjunct named in the left-hand column.

To make sure of this, he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend, while he himself has nothing but the blank Diagram, and get that genial friend to question him on this Table, _dodging_ about as much as possible. The Questions and Answers should be something like this:—

TABLE I. 

_ Adjuncts   
 of   
 Classes. _

_ Compartments,   
 or Cells,   
 assigned to them. _

#### Q.

“Adjunct for West Half?”

---

#### A.

“_y_.”

---

#### Q.

“Compartment for _x_y′_?”

---

#### A.

“North-East Cell.”

---

#### Q.

“Adjunct for South-West Cell?”

---

#### A.

“_x′_y_.”

&c., &c.

After a little practice, he will find himself able to do without the blank Diagram, and will be able to see it _mentally_ (“in my mind’s eye, Horatio!” while answering the questions of his genial friend. When _this_ result has been reached, he may safely go on to the next Chapter.

---

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _COUNTERS._

Let us agree that a _Red_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean “This Cell is _occupied_” (i.e. “There is at least _one_ Thing in it”).

Let us also agree that a _Red_ Counter, placed on the partition between two Cells, shall mean “The Compartment, made up of these two Cells, is _occupied_; but it is not known _whereabouts_, in it, its occupants are.” Hence it may be understood to mean “At least _one_ of these two Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are.”

Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind _which_ of two political parties he will join: such a man is said to be “sitting on the fence.” This phrase exactly describes the condition of the Red Counter.

Let us also agree that a _Grey_ Counter, placed within a Cell, shall mean “This Cell is _empty_” (i.e. “There is _nothing_ in it”).

> The Reader had better provide himself with 4 Red Counters and 5 Grey ones.
---

#### CHAPTER III.

##### _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS._

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

Henceforwards, in stating such Propositions as “Some _x_\-Things exist” or “No _x_\-Things are _y_\-Things”, I shall omit the word “Things”, which the Reader can supply for himself, and shall write them as “Some _x_ exist” or “No _x_ are _y_”.

> \.

A Proposition, containing only _one_ of the Letters used as Symbols for Attributes, is said to be ‘Uniliteral’.

> For example, “Some _x_ exist”, “No _y′_ exist”, &c.

A Proposition, containing _two_ Letters, is said to be ‘Biliteral’.

> For example, “Some _x_y′_ exist”, “No _x′_ are _y_”, &c.

A Proposition is said to be ‘in terms of’ the Letters it contains, whether with or without accents.

> Thus, “Some _x_y′_ exist”, “No _x′_ are _y_”, &c., are said to be _in terms of_ _x_ and _y_.
##### § 2.

###### _Representation of Propositions of Existence._

Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some _x_ exist”.

> \ Note that this Proposition is (as explained at [p. 12 equivalent to “Some existing Things are _x_\-Things.”
![Diagram representing x exists](images/b3c3d01.png)

This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _occupied_. And this we can evidently represent by placing a _Red_ Counter (here represented by a _dotted_ circle on the partition which divides the North Half.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old books exist”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some _x′_ exist”, “Some _y_ exist”, and “Some _y′_ exist”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these Propositions would be “Some new books exist”, &c.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _x_ exist”.

![Diagram representing x does not exist](images/b3c3d02.png)

This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North Half; that is, that the North Half is _empty_; that is, that the North-West Cell and the North-East Cell are both of them _empty_. And this we can represent by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.

> The Reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a _Grey_ Counter on the partition in the North Half, and that, just as a _Red_ Counter, so placed, would mean “This Half is _occupied_”, so a _Grey_ one would mean “This Half is _empty_”.
> This, however, would be a mistake. We have seen that a _Red_ Counter, so placed, would mean “At least _one_ of these two Cells is occupied: possibly _both_ are.” Hence a _Grey_ one would merely mean “At least _one_ of these two Cells is empty: possibly _both_ are”. But what we have to represent is, that both Cells are _certainly_ empty: and this can only be done by placing a _Grey_ Counter in _each_ of them.
> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old books exist”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “No _x′_ exist”, “No _y_ exist”, and “No _y′_ exist”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “No new books exist”, &c.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “Some xy exist”.

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b3c3d03.png)

This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old English books exist”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some _x_y′_ exist”, “Some _x′_y_ exist”, and “Some _x′_y′_ exist”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “Some old foreign books exist”, &c.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _x_y_ exist”.

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b3c3d04.png)

This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the North-West Cell; that is, that the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old English books exist”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “No _x_y′_ exist”, “No _x′_y_ exist”, and “No _x′_y′_ exist”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “No old foreign books exist”, &c.
![Diagram representing x does not exist](images/b3c3d05.png)

We have seen that the Proposition “No _x_ exist” may be represented by placing _two Grey_ Counters in the North Half, one in each Cell.

We have also seen that these two _Grey_ Counters, taken _separately_, represent the two Propositions “No _x_y_ exist” and “No _x_y′_ exist”.

Hence we see that the Proposition “No _x_ exist” is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions “No _x_y_ exist” and “No _x_y′_ exist”.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old books exist”.
> Hence this is a _Double_ Proposition, and is equivalent to the _two_ Propositions “No old _English_ books exist” and “No old _foreign_ books exist”.
##### § 3.

###### _Representation of Propositions of Relation._

Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_”.

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b3c3d06.png)

This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in the _West_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.

> Note that the _Subject_ of the Proposition settles which _Half_ we are to use; and that the _Predicate_ settles in which _portion_ of it we are to place the Red Counter.
> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some old books are English”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some _x_ are _y′_”, “Some _x′_ are _y_”, and “Some _x′_ are _y′_”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “Some old books are foreign”, &c.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “Some _y_ are _x_”.

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b3c3d07.png)

This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _West_ Half, is also in the _North_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_. And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “Some English books are old”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “Some _y_ are _x′_”, “Some _y′_ are _x_”, and “Some _y′_ are _x′_”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “Some English books are new”, &c.
![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b3c3d08.png)

We see that this _one_ Diagram has now served to represent no less than _three_ Propositions, viz.

  “Some _x_y_ exist;

    Some _x_ are _y_;

    Some _y_ are _x_”.

Hence these three Propositions are equivalent.

> In the “books” example, these Propositions would be
  “Some old English books exist;

    Some old books are English;

    Some English books are old”.

The two equivalent Propositions, “Some _x_ are _y_” and “Some _y_ are _x_”, are said to be ‘Converse’ to each other; and the Process, of changing one into the other, is called ‘Converting’, or ‘Conversion’.

> For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition
> “Some apples are not ripe,”
> we should first choose our Univ. (say “fruit”), and then complete the Proposition, by supplying the Substantive “fruit” in the Predicate, so that it would be
> “Some apples are not-ripe fruit”;
> and we should then convert it by interchanging its Terms, so that it would be
> “Some not-ripe fruit are apples”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Trios of equivalent Propositions; the whole Set of _four_ Trios being as follows:—

  “Some _x_y_ exist” = “Some _x_ are _y_” = “Some _y_ are _x_”.

  “Some _x_y′_ exist” = “Some _x_ are _y′_” = “Some _y′_ are _x_”.

  “Some _x′_y_ exist” = “Some _x′_ are _y_” = “Some _y_ are _x′_”.

  “Some _x′_y′_ exist” = “Some _x′_ are _y′_” = “Some _y′_ are _x′_”.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _x_ are _y_”.

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b3c3d09.png)

This tell us that no Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in the _West_ Half. Hence there is _nothing_ in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No old books are English”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “No _x_ are _y′_”, and “No _x′_ are _y_”, and “No _x′_ are _y′_”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “No old books are foreign”, &c.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _y_ are _x_”.

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b3c3d10.png)

This tells us that no Thing, in the _West_ Half, is also in the _North_ Half. Hence there is _nothing_ in the space _common_ to them, that is, in the _North-West Cell_. That is, the North-West Cell is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing a _Grey_ Counter in it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would be “No English books are old”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions “No _y_ are _x′_”, “No _y′_ are _x_”, and “No _y′_ are _x′_”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself. In the “books” example, these three Propositions would be “No English books are new”, &c.
![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b3c3d11.png)

We see that this _one_ Diagram has now served to present no less than _three_ Propositions, viz.

  “No _x_y_ exist;

    No _x_ are _y_;

    No _y_ are _x_.”

Hence these three Propositions are equivalent.

> In the “books” example, these Propositions would be
  “No old English books exist;

    No old books are English;

    No English books are old”.

The two equivalent Propositions, “No _x_ are _y_” and “No _y_ are _x_”, are said to be ‘Converse’ to each other.

> For example, if we were told to convert the Proposition
> “No porcupines are talkative”,
> we should first choose our Univ. (say “animals”), and then complete the Proposition, by supplying the Substantive “animals” in the Predicate, so that it would be
> “No porcupines are talkative animals”, and we should then convert it, by interchanging its Terms, so that it would be
> “No talkative animals are porcupines”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Trios of equivalent Propositions; the whole Set of _four_ Trios being as follows:—

  “No _x_y_ exist” = “No _x_ are _y_” = “No _y_ are _x_”.

  “No _x_y′_ exist” = “No _x_ are _y′_” = “No _y′_ are _x_”.

  “No _x′_y exist” = “No _x′_ are _y_” = “No _y_ are _x′_”.

  “No _x′_y′ exist” = “No _x′_ are _y′_” = “No _y′_ are _x′_”.

![Diagram representing all x are y](images/b3c3d12.png)

Let us take, next, the Proposition “All _x_ are _y_”.

We know (see  p. 17 that this is a _Double_ Proposition, and equivalent to the _two_ Propositions “Some _x_ are _y_” and “No _x_ are _y′_”, each of which we already know how to represent.

> Note that the _Subject_ of the given Proposition settles which _Half_ we are to use; and that its _Predicate_ settles in which _portion_ of that Half we are to place the Red Counter.

![Diagram representing x exists](images/b3c3d21.png)

   
Let us take, lastly, the Double Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_ and some are _y′_”, each part of which we already know how to represent.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Propositions, “Some _x′_ are _y_ and some are _y′_”, “Some _y_ are _x_ and some are _x′_”, “Some _y′_ are _x_ and some are _x′_”.

The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him, severely, on these two Tables. The _Inquisitor_ should have the Tables before him: but the _Victim_ should have nothing but a blank Diagram, and the Counters with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by his friend, e.g. “Some _y_ exist”, “No _y′_ are _x_”, “All _x_ are _y_”, &c. &c.

#### CHAPTER IV.

##### _INTERPRETATION OF BILITERAL DIAGRAM WHEN MARKED WITH COUNTERS._

The Diagram is supposed to be set before us, with certain Counters placed upon it; and the problem is to find out what Proposition, or Propositions, the Counters represent.

As the process is simply the reverse of that discussed in the previous Chapter, we can avail ourselves of the results there obtained, as far as they go.

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b3c4d01.png)

First, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ Counter placed in the North-West Cell.

We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions

“Some _x_y_ exist” = “Some _x_ are _y_” = “Some _y_ are _x_”.

Similarly we may interpret a _Red_ Counter, when placed in the North-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b3c4d02.png)

Next, let us suppose that we find a _Grey_ Counter placed in the North-West Cell.

We know that this represents each of the Trio of equivalent Propositions

“No _x_y_ exist” = “No _x_ are _y_” = “No _y_ are _x_”.

Similarly we may interpret a _Grey_ Counter, when placed in the North-East, or South-West, or South-East Cell.

![Diagram representing x exists](images/b3c4d03.png)

Next, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ Counter placed on the partition which divides the North Half.

We know that this represents the Proposition “Some _x_ exist.”

Similarly we may interpret a _Red_ Counter, when placed on the partition which divides the South, or West, or East Half.

![Diagram representing x exists with and without y](images/b3c4d04.png)

Next, let us suppose that we find _two Red_ Counters placed in the North Half, one in each Cell.

We know that this represents the _Double_ Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_ and some are _y′_”.

Similarly we may interpret _two Red_ Counters, when placed in the South, or West, or East Half.

![Diagram representing x does not exist](images/b3c4d05.png)

Next, let us suppose that we find _two Grey_ Counters placed in the North Half, one in each Cell.

We know that this represents the Proposition “No _x_ exist”.

Similarly we may interpret _two Grey_ Counters, when placed in the South, or West, or East Half.

![Diagram representing all x are y](images/b3c4d06.png)

Lastly, let us suppose that we find a _Red_ and a _Grey_ Counter placed in the North Half, the _Red_ in the North-_West_ Cell, and the _Grey_ in the North-_East_ Cell.

We know that this represents the Proposition, “All _x_ are _y_”.

> Note that the _Half_, occupied by the two Counters, settles what is to be the _Subject_ of the Proposition, and that the _Cell_, occupied by the _Red_ Counter, settles what is to be its _Predicate_.

Similarly we may interpret a _Red_ and a _Grey_ counter, when placed in any one of the seven similar positions

Red in North-East, Grey in North-West;  
Red in South-West, Grey in South-East;  
Red in South-East, Grey in South-West;  
Red in North-West, Grey in South-West;  
Red in South-West, Grey in North-West;  
Red in North-East, Grey in South-East;  
Red in South-East, Grey in North-East.

Once more the genial friend must be appealed to, and requested to examine the Reader on Tables II and III, and to make him not only _represent_ Propositions, but also _interpret_ Diagrams when marked with Counters.

The Questions and Answers should be like this:—

Q. Represent “No _x′_ are _y′_.”  
A. Grey Counter in S.E. Cell.  
Q. Interpret Red Counter on E. partition.  
A. “Some _y′_ exist.”  
Q. Represent “All _y′_ are _x_.”  
A. Red in N.E. Cell; Grey in S.E.  
Q. Interpret Grey Counter in S.W. Cell.  
A. “No _x′_y_ exist” = “No _x′_ are _y_” = “No _y_ are _x′_”.  

At first the Examinee will need to have the Board and Counters before him; but he will soon learn to dispense with these, and to answer with his eyes shut or gazing into vacancy.

### BOOK IV.

#### THE TRILITERAL DIAGRAM.

![An annotated biliteral diagram](images/b4c1d01.png)   

![An annotated triliteral diagram](images/b4c1d02.png)

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _SYMBOLS AND CELLS._

First, let us suppose that the above _left_\-hand Diagram is the Biliteral Diagram that we have been using in Book III., and that we change it into a _Triliteral_ Diagram by drawing an _Inner Square_, so as to divide each of its 4 Cells into 2 portions, thus making 8 Cells altogether. The _right_\-hand Diagram shows the result.

> The Reader is strongly advised, in reading this Chapter, _not_ to refer to the above Diagrams, but to make a large copy of the right-hand one for himself, _without any letters_, and to have it by him while he reads, and keep his finger on that particular _part_ of it, about which he is reading.

Secondly, let us suppose that we have selected a certain Adjunct, which we may call “_m_”, and have subdivided the _x_y_\-Class into the two Classes whose Differentiæ are _m_ and _m′_, and that we have assigned the N.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one (which we may call “the Class of _x_y_m_\-Things”, or “the _x_y_m_\-Class”), and the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other (which we may call “the Class of _x_y_m′_\-Things”, or “the _x_y_m′_\-Class”).

> Thus, in the “books” example, we might say “Let _m_ mean ‘bound’, so that _m′_ will mean ‘unbound’”, and we might suppose that we had subdivided the Class “old English books” into the two Classes, “old English bound books” and “old English unbound books”, and had assigned the N.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the N.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other.

Thirdly, let us suppose that we have subdivided the _x_y′_\-Class, the _x′_y_\-Class, and the _x′_y′_\-Class in the same manner, and have, in each case, assigned the _Inner_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute _m_, and the _Outer_ Cell to the Class possessing the Attribute _m′_.

> Thus, in the “books” example, we might suppose that we had subdivided the “new English books” into the two Classes, “new English bound books” and “new English unbound books”, and had assigned the S.W. _Inner_ Cell to the one, and the S.W. _Outer_ Cell to the other.

It is evident that we have now assigned the _Inner Square_ to the _m_\-Class, and the _Outer Border_ to the _m′_\-Class.

> Thus, in the “books” example, we have assigned the _Inner Square_ to “bound books” and the _Outer Border_ to “unbound books”.

When the Reader has made himself familiar with this Diagram, he ought to be able to find, in a moment, the Compartment assigned to a particular _pair_ of Attributes, or the Cell assigned to a particular _trio_ of Attributes. The following Rules will help him in doing this:—

  Arrange the Attributes in the order _x_, _y_, _m_.

 (2 Take the _first_ of them and find the Compartment assigned to it.

  Then take the _second_, and find what _portion_ of that compartment is assigned to it.

  Treat the _third_, if there is one, in the same way.

> For example, suppose we have to find the Compartment assigned to _y_m_. We say to ourselves “_y_ has the _West_ Half; and _m_ has the _Inner_ portion of that West Half.”
> Again, suppose we have to find the Cell assigned to _x′_y_m′_. We say to ourselves “_x′_ has the _South_ Half; _y_ has the _West_ portion of that South Half, i.e. has the _South-West Quarter_; and _m′_ has the _Outer_ portion of that South-West Quarter.”

The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the Table given on the next page, in the style of the following specimen-Dialogue.

---

#### Q.

Adjunct for South Half, Inner Portion?

#### A.

_x′_m_.

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS IN TERMS OF x AND m, OR OF y AND m._

##### § 1.

###### _Representation of Propositions of Existence in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_._

![Diagram representing x m exists](images/b4c2d01.png)

Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some _x_m_ exist”.

> \ Note that the _full_ meaning of this Proposition is (as explained at [p. 12 “Some existing Things are _x_m_\-Things”.

This tells us that there is at least _one_ Thing in the Inner portion of the North Half; that is, that this Compartment is _occupied_. And this we can evidently represent by placing a _Red_ Counter on the partition which divides it.

> In the “books” example, this Proposition would mean “Some old bound books exist” (or “There are some old bound books”).

Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions, “Some _x_m′_ exist”, “Some _x′_m_ exist”, “Some _x′_m′_ exist”, “Some _y_m_ exist”, “Some _y_m′_ exist”, “Some _y′_m_ exist”, and “Some _y′_m′_ exist”.

![Diagram representing x m does not exist](images/b4c2d02.png)

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _x_m_ exist”.

This tells us that there is _nothing_ in the Inner portion of the North Half; that is, that this Compartment is _empty_. And this we can represent by placing _two Grey_ Counters in it, one in each Cell.

Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions, in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_, viz. “No _x_m′_ exist”, “No _x′_m_ exist”, &c.

These sixteen Propositions of Existence are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram.

##### § 2.

###### _Representation of Propositions of Relation in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_._

![Diagram representing x m exists](images/b4c2d03.png)

Let us take, first, the Pair of Converse Propositions

“Some _x_ are _m_” = “Some _m_ are _x_.”

We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “Some _x_m_ exist”, which we already know how to represent.

Similarly for the seven similar Pairs, in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_.

![Diagram representing x m does not exist](images/b4c2d04.png)

Let us take, next, the Pair of Converse Propositions

“No _x_ are _m_” = “No _m_ are _x_.”

We know that each of these is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “No _x_m_ exist”, which we already know how to represent.

Similarly for the seven similar Pairs, in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_.

![Diagram representing all x are m](images/b4c2d05.png)

Let us take, next, the Proposition “All _x_ are _m_.”

We know (see  p. 18 that this is a _Double_ Proposition, and equivalent to the _two_ Propositions “Some _x_ are _m_” and “No _x_ are _m′_ ”, each of which we already know how to represent.

Similarly for the fifteen similar Propositions, in terms of _x_ and _m_, or of _y_ and _m_.

These thirty-two Propositions of Relation are the only ones that we shall have to represent on this Diagram.

The Reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the following four Tables.

The Victim should have nothing before him but a blank Triliteral Diagram, a Red Counter, and 2 Grey ones, with which he is to represent the various Propositions named by the Inquisitor, _e.g._ “No _y′_ are _m_”, “Some _x_m′_ exist”, &c., &c.

#### CHAPTER III.

##### _REPRESENTATION OF TWO PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION, ONE IN TERMS OF _x_ AND _m_, AND THE OTHER IN TERMS OF _y_ AND _m_, ON THE SAME DIAGRAM._

The Reader had better now begin to draw little Diagrams for himself, and to mark them with the Digits “I” and “O”, instead of using the Board and Counters: he may put a “I” to represent a _Red_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean “There is at least _one_ Thing here”), and a “O” to represent a _Grey_ Counter (this may be interpreted to mean “There is _nothing_ here”).

The Pair of Propositions, that we shall have to represent, will always be, one in terms of _x_ and _m_, and the other in terms of _y_ and _m_.

When we have to represent a Proposition beginning with “All”, we break it up into the _two_ Propositions to which it is equivalent.

When we have to represent, on the same Diagram, Propositions, of which some begin with “Some” and others with “No”, we represent the _negative_ ones _first_. This will sometimes save us from having to put a “I” “on a fence” and afterwards having to shift it into a Cell.

> Let us work a few examples.
> “No _x_ are _m′_;  
>   No _y′_ are _m_”.
> Let us first represent “No _x_ are _m′_”. This gives us Diagram _a_.
> Then, representing “No _y′_ are _m_” on the same Diagram, we get Diagram _b_.

>   No _m_ are _y_”.
> If, neglecting the Rule, we were begin with “Some _m_ are _x_”, we should get Diagram _a_.
> And if we were then to take “No _m_ are _y_”, which tells us that the Inner N.W. Cell is _empty_, we should be obliged to take the “I” off the fence (as it no longer has the choice of _two_ Cells), and to put it into the Inner N.E. Cell, as in Diagram _c_.
> This trouble may be saved by beginning with “No _m_ are _y_”, as in Diagram _b_.
> And _now_, when we take “Some _m_ are _x_”, there is no fence to sit on! The “I” has to go, at once, into the N.E. Cell, as in Diagram _c_.

    Some _m_ are _y_;

    No _m_ are _y′_”.

> These we will take in the order 1, 3, 2.

> Adding to this, No. (3), viz. “No _m_ are _y′_”, we get Diagram _b_.
> This time the “I”, representing No. (2), viz. “Some _m_ are _y_,” has to sit on the fence, as there is no “O” to order it off! This gives us Diagram _c_.

> And now there is no need to trouble about No. (1), as it would not add anything to our information to put a “I” on the fence. The Diagram _already_ tells us that “Some _m_ are _x_”.

#### CHAPTER IV.

##### _INTERPRETATION, IN TERMS OF _x_ AND _y_, OF TRILITERAL DIAGRAM, WHEN MARKED WITH COUNTERS OR DIGITS._

The problem before us is, given a marked Triliteral Diagram, to ascertain _what_ Propositions of Relation, in terms of _x_ and _y_, are represented on it.

The best plan, for a _beginner_, is to draw a _Biliteral_ Diagram alongside of it, and to transfer, from the one to the other, all the information he can. He can then read off, from the Biliteral Diagram, the required Propositions. After a little practice, he will be able to dispense with the Biliteral Diagram, and to read off the result from the Triliteral Diagram itself.

To _transfer_ the information, observe the following Rules:—

  Examine the N.W. Quarter of the Triliteral Diagram.

  If it contains a “I”, in _either_ Cell, it is certainly _occupied_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a “I”.

  If it contains _two_ “O”s, one in _each_ Cell, it is certainly _empty_, and you may mark the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram with a “O”.

  Deal in the same way with the N.E., the S.W., and the S.E. Quarter.

> Let us take, as examples, the results of the four Examples worked in the previous Chapters.
![Diagram representing example 1](images/b4c4d01.png)
> In the N.W. Quarter, only _one_ of the two Cells is marked as _empty_: so we do not know whether the N.W. Quarter of the Biliteral Diagram is _occupied_ or _empty_: so we cannot mark it.
![Diagram representing conclusion of example 1](images/b4c4d02.png)
> In the N.E. Quarter, we find _two_ “O”s: so _this_ Quarter is certainly _empty_; and we mark it so on the Biliteral Diagram.
> In the S.W. Quarter, we have no information _at all_.
> In the S.E. Quarter, we have not enough to use.
> We may read off the result as “No _x_ are _y′_”, or “No _y′_ are _x_,” whichever we prefer.
![Diagram representing example 2](images/b4c4d03.png)
> In the N.W. Quarter, we have not enough information to use.
![Diagram representing conclusion of example 2](images/b4c4d04.png)
> In the N.E. Quarter, we find a “I”. This shows us that it is _occupied_: so we may mark the N.E. Quarter on the Biliteral Diagram with a “I”.
> In the S.W. Quarter, we have not enough information to use.
> In the S.E. Quarter, we have none at all.
> We may read off the result as “Some _x_ are _y′_”, or “Some _y′_ are _x_”, whichever we prefer.
![Diagram representing example 3](images/b4c4d05.png)
> In the N.W. Quarter, we have _no_ information. (The “I”, sitting on the fence, is of no use to us until we know on _which_ side he means to jump down!)
![Diagram representing conclusion of example 2](images/b4c4d06.png)
> In the N.E. Quarter, we have not enough information to use.
> Neither have we in the S.W. Quarter.
> The S.E. Quarter is the only one that yields enough information to use. It is certainly _empty_: so we mark it as such on the Biliteral Diagram.
> We may read off the results as “No _x′_ are _y′_”, or “No _y′_ are _x′_”, whichever we prefer.
![Diagram representing example 4](images/b4c4d07.png)
![Diagram representing partial conclusion of example 4](images/b4c4d08.png)
> The N.W. Quarter is _occupied_, in spite of the “O” in the Outer Cell. So we mark it with a “I” on the Biliteral Diagram.
> The N.E. Quarter yields no information.
![Diagram representing complete conclusion of example 4](images/b4c4d09.png)
> The S.W. Quarter is certainly _empty_. So we mark it as such on the Biliteral Diagram.
> The S.E. Quarter does not yield enough information to use.
> We read off the result as “All _y_ are _x_.”

#### SYLLOGISMS.

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _INTRODUCTORY_

When a Trio of Biliteral Propositions of Relation is such that all their six Terms are Species of the same Genus, every two of them contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, the three Propositions are so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true, the Trio is called a ‘Syllogism’; the Genus, of which each of the six Terms is a Species, is called its ‘Universe of Discourse’, or, more briefly, its ‘Univ.’; the first two Propositions are called its ‘Premisses’, and the third its ‘Conclusion’; also the Pair of codivisional Terms in the Premisses are called its ‘Eliminands’, and the other two its ‘Retinends’.

The Conclusion of a Syllogism is said to be ‘consequent’ from its Premisses: hence it is usual to prefix to it the word “Therefore” (or the Symbol “∴”).

> Note that the ‘Eliminands’ are so called because they are _eliminated_, and do not appear in the Conclusion; and that the ‘Retinends’ are so called because they are _retained_, and _do_ appear in the Conclusion.
> Note also that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any of the Trio, but depends entirely on their _relationship to each other_.
> As a specimen-Syllogism, let us take the Trio
> “No _x_\-Things are _m_\-Things;  
>   No _y_\-Things are _m′_\-Things.  
>           No _x_\-Things are _y_\-Things.”
> which we may write, as explained at , thus:—
> “No _x_ are _m_;  
>   No _y_ are _m′_.  
>           No _x_ are _y_”.
> Here the first and second contain the Pair of codivisional Classes _m_ and _m′_; the first and third contain the Pair _x_ and _x_; and the second and third contain the Pair _y_ and _y_.
> Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see hereafter so related that, if the first two were true, the third would also be true.
> Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the two Propositions, “No _x_ are _m_” and “No _y_ are _m′_”, are its _Premisses_; the Proposition “No _x_ are _y_” is its _Conclusion_; the Terms _m_ and _m′_ are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms _x_ and _y_ are its _Retinends_.
> Hence we may write it thus:—
> “No _x_ are _m_;  
>   No _y_ are _m′_.  
>   ∴ No _x_ are _y_”.
> As a second specimen, let us take the Trio
> “All cats understand French;  
>   Some chickens are cats.  
>           Some chickens understand French”.
> These, put into normal form, are
> “All cats are creatures understanding French;  
>   Some chickens are cats.  
>           Some chickens are creatures understanding French”.
> Here all the six Terms are Species of the Genus “creatures.”
> Also the first and second Propositions contain the Pair of codivisional Classes “cats” and “cats”; the first and third contain the Pair “creatures understanding French” and “creatures understanding French”; and the second and third contain the Pair “chickens” and “chickens”.
> Also the three Propositions are (as we shall see at  p. 64 so related that, if the first two were true, the third would be true. (The first two are, as it happens, _not_ strictly true in _our_ planet. But there is nothing to hinder them from being true in some _other_ planet, say _Mars_ or _Jupiter_—in which case the third would _also_ be true in that planet, and its inhabitants would probably engage chickens as nursery-governesses. They would thus secure a singular _contingent_ privilege, unknown in England, namely, that they would be able, at any time when provisions ran short, to utilise the nursery-governess for the nursery-dinner!
> Hence the Trio is a _Syllogism_; the Genus “creatures” is its ‘Univ.’; the two Propositions, “All cats understand French“ and ”Some chickens are cats”, are its _Premisses_, the Proposition “Some chickens understand French” is its _Conclusion_; the Terms “cats” and “cats” are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms, “creatures understanding French” and “chickens”, are its _Retinends_.
> Hence we may write it thus:—
> “All cats understand French;  
>   Some chickens are cats;  
>   ∴ Some chickens understand French”.

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _PROBLEMS IN SYLLOGISMS._

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

When the Terms of a Proposition are represented by _words_, it is said to be ‘concrete’; when by _letters_, ‘abstract.’

To translate a Proposition from concrete into abstract form, we fix on a Univ., and regard each Term as a _Species_ of it, and we choose a letter to represent its _Differentia_.

> \ For example, suppose we wish to translate “Some soldiers are brave” into abstract form. We may take “men” as Univ., and regard “soldiers” and “brave men” as _Species_ of the _Genus_ “men”; and we may choose _x_ to represent the peculiar Attribute (say “military” of “soldiers,” and _y_ to represent “brave.” Then the Proposition may be written “Some military men are brave men”; _i.e._ “Some _x_\-men are _y_\-men”; _i.e._ (omitting “men,” as explained at [p. 26 “Some _x_ are _y_.”
> In practice, we should merely say “Let Univ. be “men”, _x_ = soldiers, _y_ = brave”, and at once translate “Some soldiers are brave” into “Some _x_ are _y_.”

The Problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds, viz.

  “Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them.”

  “Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism: to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is _complete_.”

These Problems we will discuss separately.

##### § 2.

###### _Given a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—

  Determine the ‘Universe of Discourse’.

  Construct a Dictionary, making _m_ and _m_ (or _m_ and _m′_ represent the pair of codivisional Classes, and _x_ (or _x′_ and _y_ (or _y′_ the other two.

  Translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form.

  Represent them, together, on a Triliteral Diagram.

  Ascertain what Proposition, if any, in terms of _x_ and _y_, is _also_ represented on it.

  Translate this into concrete form.

It is evident that, if the proposed Premisses were true, this other Proposition would _also_ be true. Hence it is a _Conclusion_ consequent from the proposed Premisses.

> Let us work some examples.
> “No son of mine is dishonest;  
>   People always treat an honest man with respect”.
> Taking “men” as Univ., we may write these as follows:—
> “No sons of mine are dishonest men;  
>   All honest men are men treated with respect”.
> We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. _m_ = honest; _x_ = sons of mine; _y_ = treated with respect.
> (Note that the expression “_x_ = sons of mine” is an abbreviated form of “_x_ = the Differentia of ‘sons of mine’, when regarded as a Species of ‘men’”.)
> The next thing is to translate the proposed Premisses into abstract form, as follows:—
> “No _x_ are _m′_;  
>   All _m_ are _y_”.
![Diagram representing x m prime does not exist and all m are y](images/b5c2d01.png)
> Next, by the process described at , we represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, thus:—
![Diagram representing x y prime does not exist](images/b5c2d02.png)
> Next, by the process described at , we transfer to a Biliteral Diagram all the information we can.
> The result we read as “No _x_ are _y′_” or as “No _y′_ are _x_,” whichever we prefer. So we refer to our Dictionary, to see which will look best; and we choose
> “No _x_ are _y′_”,
> which, translated into concrete form, is
> “No son of mine fails to be treated with respect”.
> “All cats understand French;  
>   Some chickens are cats”.
> Taking “creatures” as Univ., we write these as follows:—
> “All cats are creatures understanding French;  
>   Some chickens are cats”.
> We can now construct our Dictionary, viz. _m_ = cats; _x_ = understanding French; _y_ = chickens.
> The proposed Premisses, translated into abstract form, are
> “All _m_ are _x_;  
>   Some _y_ are _m_”.
> In order to represent these on a Triliteral Diagram, we break up the first into the two Propositions to which it is equivalent, and thus get the _three_ Propositions
  “Some _m_ are _x_;

    No _m_ are _x′_;

    Some _y_ are _m_”.

![Diagram representing x m and y m exist and x prime m does not exist](images/b5c2d03.png)
> The Rule, given at , would make us take these in the order 2, 1, 3.
> This, however, would produce the result
![Alternative diagram representing x m and y m exist and x prime m does not exist](images/b5c2d04.png)
> So it would be better to take them in the order 2, 3, 1. Nos. (2 and (3 give us the result here shown; and now we need not trouble about No. (1), as the Proposition “Some _m_ are _x_” is _already_ represented on the Diagram.
![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b5c2d05.png)
> Transferring our information to a Biliteral Diagram, we get

> “All diligent students are successful;

> These Premisses, in abstract form, are
> “All _x_ are _m_;  
>   All _y_ are _m′_”.
> These, broken up, give us the four Propositions
  “Some _x_ are _m_;

    No _x_ are _m′_;

    Some _y_ are _m′_;

    No _y_ are _m_”.

> “Not _true!_” you exclaim. “Then who _were_ they, who were sentenced to imprisonment and were also sentenced to hard labour? They _must_ have had the verdict ‘guilty’ returned against them, or how could they be sentenced?”
> Well, it happened like _this_, you see. They were three ruffians, who had committed highway-robbery. When they were put on their trial, they _pleaded_ ‘guilty’. So no _verdict_ was returned at all; and they were sentenced at once.

I will now work out, in their briefest form, as models for the Reader to imitate in working examples, the above four concrete Problems.

###### (1 \ see [p. 60 

“No son of mine is dishonest;  
  People always treat an honest man with respect.”

Univ. “men”; _m_ = honest; _x_ = my sons; _y_ = treated with respect.

“No _x_ are _m′_;  
 All _m_ are _y_.”

![Diagram representing x m prime does not exist and all m are y](images/b5c2d09.png)

![Diagram representing x y prime does not exist](images/b5c2d10.png)

i.e. “No son of mine ever fails to be treated with respect.”

###### (2 \ see [p. 61 

“All cats understand French;  
  Some chickens are cats”.

Univ. “creatures”; _m_ = cats; _x_ = understanding French; _y_ = chickens.

“All _m_ are _x_;  
 Some _y_ are _m_.”

![Diagram representing all m are x and y m exists](images/b5c2d11.png)

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b5c2d12.png)

i.e. “Some chickens understand French.”

###### (3 \ see [p. 62 

“All diligent students are successful;  
  All ignorant students are unsuccessful”.

Univ. “students”; _m_ = successful; _x_ = diligent; _y_ = ignorant.

“All _x_ are _m_;  
 All _y_ are _m′_.”

![Diagram representing all x are m and all y are m prime](images/b5c2d13.png)

![Diagram representing all x are y prime and all y are x prime](images/b5c2d14.png)

    All _y_ are _x′_.”

i.e. “All diligent students are learned; and all ignorant students are idle”.

###### (4 \ see [p. 63 

“Of the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes, all, against whom the verdict ‘guilty’ was returned, were sentenced to imprisonment;

Some, who were sentenced to imprisonment, were also sentenced to hard labour”.

Univ. “prisoners who were put on their trial at the last Assizes”, _m_ = sentenced to imprisonment; _x_ = against whom the verdict ‘guilty’ was returned; _y_ = sentenced to hard labour.

“All _x_ are _m_;  
 Some _m_ are _y_.”

![Diagram representing all x are m and y m exists](images/b5c2d15.png)

There is no Conclusion.

. Work Examples § 1, 17–21 (); § 4, 1–6 (); § 5, 1–6 ().

##### § 3.

###### _Given a Trio of Propositions of Relation, of which every two contain a Pair of codivisional Classes, and which are proposed as a Syllogism; to ascertain whether the proposed Conclusion is consequent from the proposed Premisses, and, if so, whether it is complete._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—

  Take the proposed Premisses, and ascertain, by the process described at  p. 60 

  If there be _no_ Conclusion, say so.

  If there _be_ a Conclusion, compare it with the proposed Conclusion, and pronounce accordingly.

I will now work out, in their briefest form, as models for the Reader to imitate in working examples, six Problems.

###### (1)

“All soldiers are strong;  
  All soldiers are brave.  
          Some strong men are brave.”

Univ. “men”; _m_ = soldiers; _x_ = strong; _y_ = brave.

“All _m_ are _x_;  
 All _m_ are _y_.  
   Some _x_ are _y_.”

![Diagram representing all m are x and all m are y](images/b5c2d16.png)

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/b5c2d17.png)

Hence proposed Conclusion is right.

###### (2)

“I admire these pictures;  
  When I admire anything I wish to examine it thoroughly.  
      I wish to examine some of these pictures thoroughly.”

Univ. “things”; _m_ = admired by me; _x_ = these pictures; _y_ = things which I wish to examine thoroughly.

“All _x_ are _m_;  
 All _m_ are _y_.  
   Some _x_ are _y_.”

![Diagram representing all x are m and all m are y](images/b5c2d18.png)

![Diagram representing all x are y](images/b5c2d19.png)

Hence proposed Conclusion is _incomplete_, the _complete_ one being “I wish to examine _all_ these pictures thoroughly”.

###### (3)

“None but the brave deserve the fair;  
  Some braggarts are cowards.  
      Some braggarts do not deserve the fair.”

Univ. “persons”; _m_ = brave; _x_ = deserving of the fair; _y_ = braggarts.

“No _m′_ are _x_;  
 Some _y_ are _m′_.  
   Some _y_ are _x′_.”

![Diagram representing x m prime does not exist and y m prime exists](images/b5c2d20.png)

![Diagram representing x prime y exists](images/b5c2d21.png)

Hence proposed Conclusion is right.

###### (4)

“All soldiers can march;  
  Some babies are not soldiers.  
      Some babies cannot march”.

Univ. “persons”; _m_ = soldiers; _x_ = able to march; _y_ = babies.

“All _m_ are _x_;  
 Some _y_ are _m′_.  
   Some _y_ are _x′_.”

![Diagram representing all m are x and y m prime exists](images/b5c2d22.png)

There is no Conclusion.

###### (5)

“All selfish men are unpopular;  
  All obliging men are popular.  
      All obliging men are unselfish”.

Univ. “men”; _m_ = popular; _x_ = selfish; _y_ = obliging.

“All _x_ are _m′_;  
 All _y_ are _m_.  
   All _y_ are _x′_.”

![Diagram representing all x are m prime and all y are x prime](images/b5c2d23.png)

![Diagram representing all x are y prime and all y are x prime](images/b5c2d24.png)

   All _y_ are _x′_.”

Hence proposed Conclusion is _incomplete_, the _complete_ one containing, in addition, “All selfish men are disobliging”.

”No one, who means to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, and has not enough time to walk to the station, can do without running;

  This party of tourists mean to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, but they have plenty of time to walk to the station.

              This party of tourists need not run.”

Univ. “persons meaning to go by the train, and unable to get a conveyance”; _m_ = having enough time to walk to the station; _x_ = needing to run; _y_ = these tourists.

“No _m′_ are _x′_;  
 All _y_ are _m_.  
   All _y_ are _x′_.”

There is no Conclusion.

> Here is _another_ opportunity, gentle Reader, for playing a trick on your innocent friend. Put the proposed Syllogism before him, and ask him what he thinks of the Conclusion.
> He will reply “Why, it’s perfectly correct, of course! And if your precious Logic-book tells you it _isn’t_, don’t believe it! You don’t mean to tell me those tourists _need_ to run? If _I_ were one of them, and knew the _Premisses_ to be true, I should be _quite_ clear that I _needn’t_ run—and I _should walk!_”
> And _you_ will reply “But suppose there was a mad bull behind you?”
> And then your innocent friend will say “Hum! Ha! I must think that over a bit!”
> You may then explain to him, as a convenient _test_ of the soundness of a Syllogism, that, if circumstances can be invented which, without interfering with the truth of the _Premisses_, would make the _Conclusion_ false, the Syllogism _must_ be unsound.

### THE METHOD OF SUBSCRIPTS.

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _INTRODUCTORY._

Let us agree that “_x_1” shall mean “Some existing Things have the Attribute _x_”, i.e. (more briefly “Some _x_ exist”; also that “_x_y_1” shall mean “Some _x_y_ exist”, and so on. Such a Proposition may be called an ‘Entity.’

> Note that, when there are _two_ letters in the expression, it does not in the least matter which stands _first_: “_x_y_1” and “_y_x_1” mean exactly the same.

Also that “_x_0” shall mean “No existing Things have the Attribute _x_”, i.e. (more briefly “No _x_ exist”; also that “_x_y_0” shall mean “No _x_y_ exist”, and so on. Such a Proposition may be called a ‘Nullity’.

Also that “†” shall mean “and”.

> Thus “_a_b_1 † _c_d_0” means “Some _a_b_ exist and no _c_d_ exist”.

Also that “¶” shall mean “would, if true, prove”.

> Thus, “_x_0 ¶ _x_y_0” means “The Proposition ‘No _x_ exist’ would, if true, prove the Proposition ‘No _x_y_ exist’”.

When two Letters are both of them accented, or both _not_ accented, they are said to have ‘Like Signs’, or to be ‘Like’: when one is accented, and the other not, they are said to have ‘Unlike Signs’, or to be ‘Unlike’.

---

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _REPRESENTATION OF PROPOSITIONS OF RELATION._

Let us take, first, the Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_”.

This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “Some _x_y_ exist”. (See  p. 31 

The Converse Proposition “Some _y_ are _x_” may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. “_x_y_1”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.—

“Some _x_ are _y′_”  = “Some _y′_ are _x_”,  
“Some _x′_ are _y_”  = “Some _y_ are _x′_”,  
“Some _x′_ are _y′_” = “Some _y′_ are _x′_”.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “No _x_ are _y_”.

This, we know, is equivalent to the Proposition of Existence “No _x_y_ exist”. (See  p. 33 

The Converse Proposition “No _y_ are _x_” may of course be represented by the _same_ expression, viz. “_x_y_0”.

Similarly we may represent the three similar Pairs of Converse Propositions, viz.—

“No _x_ are _y′_”  = “No _y′_ are _x_”,  
“No _x′_ are _y_”  = “No _y_ are _x′_”,  
“No _x′_ are _y′_” = “No _y′_ are _x′_”.

Let us take, next, the Proposition “All _x_ are _y_”.

Now it is evident that the Double Proposition of Existence “Some _x_ exist and no _x_y′_ exist” tells us that _some_ _x_\-Things exist, but that _none_ of them have the Attribute _y′_: that is, it tells us that _all_ of them have the Attribute _y_: that is, it tells us that “All _x_ are _y_”.

Also it is evident that the expression “_x_1 † _x_y′_0” represents this Double Proposition.

Hence it also represents the Proposition “All _x_ are _y_”.

> \, to be equivalent to the Double Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_ and no _x_ are _y′_” (i.e. “Some _x_y_ exist and no _x_y′_ exist”). The explanation is that the Proposition “Some _x_y_ exist” contains _superfluous information_. “Some _x_ exist” is enough for our purpose.

This expression may be written in a shorter form, viz. “_x_1_y′_0”, since _each_ Subscript takes effect back to the _beginning_ of the expression.

Similarly we may represent the seven similar Propositions “All _x_ are _y′_”, “All _x′_ are _y_”, “All _x′_ are _y′_”, “All _y_ are _x_”, “All _y_ are _x′_”, “All _y′_ are _x_”, and “All _y′_ are _x′_”.

> The Reader should make out all these for himself.

It will be convenient to remember that, in translating a Proposition, beginning with “All”, from abstract form into subscript form, or _vice versâ_, the Predicate _changes sign_ (that is, changes from positive to negative, or else from negative to positive).

> Thus, the Proposition “All _y_ are _x′_” becomes “_y_1_x_0”, where the Predicate changes from _x′_ to _x_.
> Again, the expression “_x′_1_y′_0” becomes “All _x′_ are _y_”, where the Predicate changes for _y′_ to _y_.
---

#### CHAPTER III.

##### _SYLLOGISMS._

##### § 1.

###### _Representation of Syllogisms._

We already know how to represent each of the three Propositions of a Syllogism in subscript form. When that is done, all we need, besides, is to write the three expressions in a row, with “†” between the Premisses, and “¶” before the Conclusion.

> Thus the Syllogism
> “No _x_ are _m′_;  
>   All _m_ are _y_.  
>         ∴ No _x_ are _y′_.”
> may be represented thus:—
> _x_m′_0 † _m_1_y′_0 ¶ _x_y′_0
> When a Proposition has to be translated from concrete form into subscript form, the Reader will find it convenient, just at first, to translate it into _abstract_ form, and _thence_ into subscript form. But, after a little practice, he will find it quite easy to go straight from concrete form to subscript form.
##### § 2.

###### _Formulæ for solving Problems in Syllogisms._

When once we have found, by Diagrams, the Conclusion to a given Pair of Premisses, and have represented the Syllogism in subscript form, we have a _Formula_, by which we can at once find, without having to use Diagrams again, the Conclusion to any _other_ Pair of Premisses having the _same_ subscript forms.

> Thus, the expression
> is a Formula, by which we can find the Conclusion to any Pair of Premisses whose subscript forms are
> For example, suppose we had the Pair of Propositions
> “No gluttons are healthy;  
>   No unhealthy men are strong”.
proposed as Premisses. Taking “men” as our ‘Universe’, and making _m_ = healthy; _x_ = gluttons; _y_ = strong; we might translate the Pair into abstract form, thus:—

> “No _x_ are _m_;  
> No _m′_ are _y_”.
> These, in subscript form, would be
> which are identical with those in our _Formula_. Hence we at once know the Conclusion to be
> that is, in abstract form,
> that is, in concrete form,
> “No gluttons are strong”.

I shall now take three different forms of Pairs of Premisses, and work out their Conclusions, once for all, by Diagrams; and thus obtain some useful Formulæ. I shall call them “Fig. I”, “Fig. II”, and “Fig. III”.

###### Fig. I.

This includes any Pair of Premisses which are both of them Nullities, and which contain Unlike Eliminands.

The simplest case is

![Diagram representing x m and y m prime do not exist](images/b6c3d01.png)

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/b6c3d02.png)

In this case we see that the Conclusion is a Nullity, and that the Retinends have kept their Signs.

And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions.

> The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as

If either Retinend is asserted in the _Premisses_ to exist, of course it may be so asserted in the _Conclusion_.

Hence we get two _Variants_ of Fig. I, viz.

α where _one_ Retinend is so asserted;

β where _both_ are so asserted.

> The Reader had better work out, on Diagrams, examples of these two Variants, such as

The Formula, to be remembered, is with the following two Rules:—

  _Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a Nullity, in which both Retinends keep their Signs._

  _A Retinend, asserted in the Premisses to exist, may be so asserted in the Conclusion._

> Note that Rule (1 is merely the Formula expressed in words.
###### Fig. II.

This includes any Pair of Premisses, of which one is a Nullity and the other an Entity, and which contain Like Eliminands.

The simplest case is

_x_m_0 † _y_m_1

![Diagram representing x m does not exist and y m does exist](images/b6c3d03.png)

![Diagram representing x prime y exists](images/b6c3d04.png)

In this case we see that the Conclusion is an Entity, and that the Nullity-Retinend has changed its Sign.

And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions.

> The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as
> _x′_m_0 † _y_m_1 (which ¶ _x_y_1
> _x_1_m′_0 † _y′_m′_1 (which ¶ _x′_y′_1
> _m_1_x_0 † _y′_m_1 (which ¶ _x′_y′_1).

The Formula, to be remembered, is,

_x_m_0 † _y_m_1 ¶ _x′_y_1

with the following Rule:—

_A Nullity and an Entity, with Like Eliminands, yield an Entity, in which the Nullity-Retinend changes its Sign._

> Note that this Rule is merely the Formula expressed in words.
###### Fig. III.

This includes any Pair of Premisses which are both of them Nullities, and which contain Like Eliminands asserted to exist.

The simplest case is

_x_m_0 † _y_m_0 † _m_1

> Note that “_m_1” is here stated _separately_, because it does not matter in which of the two Premisses it occurs: so that this includes the _three_ forms “_m_1_x_0 † _y_m_0”, “_x_m_0 † _m_1_y_0”, and “_m_1_x_0 † _m_1_y_0”.
![Diagram representing x m and y m do not exist and m does exist](images/b6c3d05.png)

![Diagram representing x prime y prime exists](images/b6c3d06.png)

In this case we see that the Conclusion is an Entity, and that _both_ Retinends have changed their Signs.

And we should find this Rule to hold good with _any_ Pair of Premisses which fulfil the given conditions.

> The Reader had better satisfy himself of this, by working out, on Diagrams, several varieties, such as
> _x′_m_0 † _m_1_y_0 (which ¶ _x_y′_1
> _m′_1_x_0 † _m′_y′_0 (which ¶ _x′_y_1
> _m_1_x′_0 † _m_1_y′_0 (which ¶ _x_y_1).

The Formula, to be remembered, is

_x_m_0 † _y_m_0 † _m_1 ¶ _x′_y′_1

with the following Rule (which is merely the Formula expressed in words):—

_Two Nullities, with Like Eliminands asserted to exist, yield an Entity, in which both Retinends change their Signs._

In order to help the Reader to remember the peculiarities and Formulæ of these three Figures, I will put them all together in one Table.

TABLE IX.

_x_m_0 † _y_m′_0 ¶ _x_y_0

Two Nullities, with Unlike Eliminands, yield a Nullity, in which both Retinends keep their Signs.

A Retinend, asserted in the Premisses to exist, may be so asserted in the Conclusion.

_x_m_0 † _y_m_1 ¶ _x′_y_1

A Nullity and an Entity, with Like Eliminands, yield an Entity, in which the Nullity-Retinend changes its Sign.

_x_m_0 † _y_m_0 † _m_1 ¶ _x′_y′_1

Two Nullities, with Like Eliminands asserted to exist, yield an Entity, in which both Retinends change their Signs.

I will now work out, by these Formulæ, as models for the Reader to imitate, some Problems in Syllogisms which have been already worked, by Diagrams, in 

###### (1 \ see [p. 64 

“No son of mine is dishonest;  
  People always treat an honest man with respect.”

Univ. “men”; _m_ = honest; _x_ = my sons; _y_ = treated with respect.

_x_m′_0 † _m_1_y′_0 ¶ _x_y′_0         Fig. I.

_i.e._ “No son of mine ever fails to be treated with respect.”

###### (2 \ see [p. 64 

“All cats understand French;  
  Some chickens are cats.”

Univ. “creatures”; _m_ = cats; _x_ = understanding French; _y_ = chickens.

_m_1_x′_0 † _y_m_1 ¶ _x_y_1         Fig. II.

_i.e._ “Some chickens understand French.”

###### (3 \ see [p. 64 

“All diligent students are successful;  
  All ignorant students are unsuccessful.”

Univ. “students”; _m_ = successful; _x_ = diligent; _y_ = ignorant.

_x_1_m′_0 † _y_1_m_0 ¶ _x_1_y_0 † _y_1_x_0         Fig. I (β).

_i.e._ “All diligent students are learned; and all ignorant students are idle.”

###### (4 \ see [p. 66 

“All soldiers are strong;  
  All soldiers are brave.  
          Some strong men are brave.”

Univ. “men”; _m_ = soldiers; _x_ = strong; _y_ = brave.

_m_1_x′_0 † _m_1_y′_0 ¶ _x_y_1         Fig. III.

Hence proposed Conclusion is right.

###### (5 \ see [p. 67 

“I admire these pictures;  
  When I admire anything, I wish to examine it thoroughly.  
          I wish to examine some of these pictures thoroughly.”

Univ. “things”; _m_ = admired by me; _x_ = these; _y_ = things which I wish to examine thoroughly.

_x_1_m′_0 † _m_1_y′_0 ¶ _x_1_y′_0         Fig. I (α).

Hence proposed Conclusion, _x_y_1, is _incomplete_, the _complete_ one being “I wish to examine _all_ these pictures thoroughly.”

###### (6 \ see [p. 67 

“None but the brave deserve the fair;  
  Some braggarts are cowards.  
          Some braggarts do not deserve the fair.”

Univ. “persons”; _m_ = brave; _x_ = deserving of the fair; _y_ = braggarts.

_m′_x_0 † _y_m′_1 ¶ _x′_y_1         Fig. II.

Hence proposed Conclusion is right.

###### (7 \ see [p. 69 

”No one, who means to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, and has not enough time to walk to the station, can do without running;  
  This party of tourists mean to go by the train and cannot get a conveyance, but they have plenty of time to walk to the station.  
        This party of tourists need not run.”

Univ. “persons meaning to go by the train, and unable to get a conveyance”; _m_ = having enough time to walk to the station; _x_ = needing to run; _y_ = these tourists.

_m′_x′_0 † _y_1_m′_0 do not come under any of the three Figures. Hence it is necessary to return to the Method of Diagrams, as shown at .

Hence there is no Conclusion.

> \); § 5, 13–24 (,  .
##### § 3.

###### _Fallacies._

Any argument which _deceives_ us, by seeming to prove what it does not really prove, may be called a ‘Fallacy’ (derived from the Latin verb _fallo_ “I deceive”): but the particular kind, to be now discussed, consists of a Pair of Propositions, which are proposed as the Premisses of a Syllogism, but yield no Conclusion.

When each of the proposed Premisses is a Proposition in _I_, or _E_, or _A_, (the only kinds with which we are now concerned, the Fallacy may be detected by the ‘Method of Diagrams,’ by simply setting them out on a Triliteral Diagram, and observing that they yield no information which can be transferred to the Biliteral Diagram.

But suppose we were working by the ‘Method of _Subscripts_,’ and had to deal with a Pair of proposed Premisses, which happened to be a ‘Fallacy,’ how could we be certain that they would not yield any Conclusion?

Our best plan is, I think, to deal with _Fallacies_ in the same was as we have already dealt with _Syllogisms_: that is, to take certain forms of Pairs of Propositions, and to work  them out, once for all, on the Triliteral Diagram, and ascertain that they yield _no_ Conclusion; and then to record them, for future use, as _Formulæ for Fallacies_, just as we have already recorded our three _Formulæ for Syllogisms_.

Now, if we were to record the two Sets of Formulæ in the _same_ shape, viz. by the Method of Subscripts, there would be considerable risk of confusing the two kinds. Hence, in order to keep them distinct, I propose to record the Formulæ for _Fallacies_ in _words_, and to call them “Forms” instead of “Formulæ.”

Let us now proceed to find, by the Method of Diagrams, three “Forms of Fallacies,” which we will then put on record for future use. They are as follows:—

  Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.

  Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss.

  Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses.

These shall be discussed separately, and it will be seen that each fails to yield a Conclusion.

###### (1 _Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist._

It is evident that neither of the given Propositions can be an _Entity_, since that kind asserts the _existence_ of both of its Terms (see
. Hence they must both be _Nullities_.

Hence the given Pair may be represented by (_x_m_0 † _y_m_0), with or without _x_1, _y_1.

These, set out on Triliteral Diagrams, are

_x_m_0 † _y_m_0

_x_1_m_0 † _y_m_0

![Diagram representing x m and y m do not exist](images/b6c3d07.png)

![Diagram representing all x are m prime and y m does not exist](images/b6c3d08.png)

_x_m_0 † _y_1_m_0

_x_1_m_0 † _y_1_m_0

![Diagram representing x m does not exist and all y are m prime](images/b6c3d09.png)

![Diagram representing all x are m prime and all y are m prime](images/b6c3d10.png)

###### (2 _Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss._

Here the given Pair may be represented by (_x_m_0 † _y_m′_1 with or without _x_1 or _m_1.

These, set out on Triliteral Diagrams, are

_x_m_0 † _y_m′_1_

_x_1_m_0 † _y_m′_1_

_m_1_x_0 † _y_m′_1_

![Diagram representing x m does not exist and y m prime does exist](images/b6c3d11.png)

![Diagram representing all x are m prime and y m prime exists](images/b6c3d12.png)

![Diagram representing all m are x prime and y m prime exists](images/b6c3d13.png)

###### (3 _Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses._

Here the given Pair may be represented by either (_x_m_1 † _y_m_1 or (_x_m_1 † _y_m′_1_).

These, set out on Triliteral Diagrams, are

_x_m_1 † _y_m_1_

_x_m_1 † _y_m′_1_

![Diagram representing x m and y m exist](images/b6c3d14.png)

![Diagram representing x m and y m prime exist](images/b6c3d15.png)

##### § 4.

###### _Method of proceeding with a given Pair of Propositions._

Let us suppose that we have before us a Pair of Propositions of Relation, which contain between them a Pair of codivisional Classes, and that we wish to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them. We translate them, if necessary, into subscript-form, and then proceed as follows:—

  We examine their Subscripts, in order to see whether they are

a a Pair of Nullities;

or (b a Nullity and an Entity;

or (c a Pair of Entities.

  If they are a Pair of Nullities, we examine their Eliminands, in order to see whether they are Unlike or Like.

If their Eliminands are _Unlike_, it is a case of Fig. I. We then examine their Retinends, to see whether one or both of them are asserted to _exist_. If one Retinend is so asserted, it is a case of Fig. I (α); if both, it is a case of Fig. I (β).

If their Eliminands are Like, we examine them, in order to see whether either of them is asserted to exist. If so, it is a case of Fig. III.; if not, it is a case of “Fallacy of Like Eliminands not asserted to exist.”

> If they are a Nullity and an Entity, we examine their Eliminands, in order to see whether they are Like or Unlike.

If their Eliminands are Like, it is a case of Fig. II.; if _Unlike_, it is a case of “Fallacy of Unlike Eliminands with an Entity-Premiss.”

> If they are a Pair of Entities, it is a case of “Fallacy of two Entity-Premisses.”

#### BOOK VII.

### SORITESES.

---

#### CHAPTER I.

##### _INTRODUCTORY._

When a Set of three or more Biliteral Propositions are such that all their Terms are Species of the same Genus, and are also so related that two of them, taken together, yield a Conclusion, which, taken with another of them, yields another Conclusion, and so on, until all have been taken, it is evident that, if the original Set were true, the last Conclusion would _also_ be true.

Such a Set, with the last Conclusion tacked on, is called a ‘Sorites’; the original Set of Propositions is called its ‘Premisses’; each of the intermediate Conclusions is called a ‘Partial Conclusion’ of the Sorites; the last Conclusion is called its ‘Complete Conclusion,’ or, more briefly, its ‘Conclusion’; the Genus, of which all the Terms are Species, is called its ‘Universe of Discourse’, or, more briefly, its ‘Univ.’; the Terms, used as Eliminands in the Syllogisms, are called its ‘Eliminands’; and the two Terms, which are retained, and therefore appear in the Conclusion, are called its ‘Retinends’.

> Note that each _Partial_ Conclusion contains one or two _Eliminands_; but that the _Complete_ Conclusion contains _Retinends_ only.

The Conclusion is said to be ‘consequent’ from the Premisses; for which reason it is usual to prefix to it the word “Therefore” (or the symbol “∴”).

> Note that the question, whether the Conclusion is or is not _consequent_ from the Premisses, is not affected by the _actual_ truth or falsity of any one of the Propositions which make up the Sorites, by depends entirely on their _relationship to one another_.
> As a specimen-Sorites, let us take the following Set of 5 Propositions:—
  ”No _a_ are _b′_;

    All _b_ are _c_;

    All _c_ are _d_;

    No _e′_ are _a′_;

    All _h_ are _e′_”.

> Here the first and second, taken together, yield “No _a_ are _c′_”.
> This, taken along with the third, yields “No _a_ are _d′_”.
> This, taken along with the fourth, yields “No _d′_ are _e′_”.
> And this, taken along with the fifth, yields “All _h_ are _d_”.
> Hence, if the original Set were true, this would _also_ be true.
> Hence the original Set, with this tacked on, is a _Sorites_; the original Set is its _Premisses_; the Proposition “All _h_ are _d_” is its _Conclusion_; the Terms _a_, _b_, _c_, _e_ are its _Eliminands_; and the Terms _d_ and _h_ are its _Retinends_.
> Hence we may write the whole Sorites thus:—
> ”No _a_ are _b′_;  
>   All _b_ are _c_;  
>   All _c_ are _d_;  
>   No _e′_ are _a′_;  
>   All _h_ are _e′_.  
>           ∴ All _h_ are _d_”.
> In the above Sorites, the 3 Partial Conclusions are the Positions “No _a_ are _e′_”, “No _a_ are _d′_”, “No _d′_ are _e′_”; but, if the Premisses were arranged in other ways, other Partial Conclusions might be obtained. Thus, the order 41523 yields the Partial Conclusions “No _c′_ are _b′_”, “All _h_ are _b_”, “All _h_ are _c_”. There are altogether _nine_ Partial Conclusions to this Sorites, which the Reader will find it an interesting task to make out for himself.

#### CHAPTER II.

##### _PROBLEMS IN SORITESES._

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

The Problems we shall have to solve are of the following form:—

“Given three or more Propositions of Relation, which are proposed as Premisses: to ascertain what Conclusion, if any, is consequent from them.”

We will limit ourselves, at present, to Problems which can be worked by the Formulæ of Fig. I. (See  p. 75 

Such Problems may be solved by either of two Methods, viz.

  The Method of Separate Syllogisms;

  The Method of Underscoring.

These shall be discussed separately.

##### § 2.

###### _Solution by Method of Separate Syllogisms._

The Rules, for doing this, are as follows:—

  Name the ‘Universe of Discourse’.

  Construct a Dictionary, making _a_, _b_, _c_, &c. represent the Terms.

  Put the Proposed Premisses into subscript form.

  Select two which, containing between them a pair of codivisional Classes, can be used as the Premisses of a Syllogism.

  Find their Conclusion by Formula.

  Find a third Premiss which, along with this Conclusion, can be used as the Premisses of a second Syllogism.

  Find a second Conclusion by Formula.

  Proceed thus, until all the proposed Premisses have been used.

  Put the last Conclusion, which is the Complete Conclusion of the Sorites, into concrete form.

> As an example of this process, let us take, as the proposed Set of Premisses,
  “All the policemen on this beat sup with our cook;

    No man with long hair can fail to be a poet;

    Amos Judd has never been in prison;

    Our cook’s ‘cousins’ all love cold mutton;

    None but policemen on this beat are poets;

###### _Solution by Method of Underscoring._

Consider the Pair of Premisses

_x_m_0 † _y_m′_0

which yield the Conclusion _x_y_0

We see that, in order to get this Conclusion, we must eliminate _m_ and _m′_, and write _x_ and _y_ together in one expression.

Now, if we agree to _mark_ _m_ and _m′_ as eliminated, and to read the two expressions together, as if they were written in one, the two Premisses will then exactly represent the _Conclusion_, and we need not write it out separately.

Let us agree to mark the eliminated letters by _underscoring_ them, putting a _single_ score under the _first_, and a _double_ one under the _second_.

The two Premisses now become

_x_m_0 † _y_m_′0

which we read as “_x_y_0_”.

In copying out the Premisses for underscoring, it will be convenient to _omit all subscripts_. As to the “0’s” we may always _suppose_ them written, and, as to the “1’s”, we are not concerned to know _which_ Terms are asserted to _exist_, except those which appear in the _Complete_ Conclusion; and for _them_ it will be easy enough to refer to the original list.

> \
> The Data are
> 1_k_1_l′_0 † 2_d_h′_0 † 3_a_1_c_0 † 4_b_1_e′_0 † 5_k′_h_0 † 6_b′_l_0 † 7_d′_1_c′_0
> The Reader should take a piece of paper, and write out this solution for himself. The first line will consist of the above Data; the second must be composed, bit by bit, according to the following directions.
> We begin by writing down the first Premiss, with its numeral over it, but omitting the subscripts.
> We have now to find a Premiss which can be combined with this, _i.e._, a Premiss containing either _k′_ or _l_. The first we find is No. 5; and this we tack on, with a †.
> To get the _Conclusion_ from these, _k_ and _k′_ must be eliminated, and what remains must be taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them, putting a _single_ score under _k_, and a _double_ one under _k′_. The result we read as _l′_h_.
> We must now find a Premiss containing either _l_ or _h′_. Looking along the row, we fix on No. 2, and tack it on.
> Now these 3 Nullities are really equivalent to (_l′_h_ † _d_h′_), in which _h_ and _h′_ must be eliminated, and what remains taken as one expression. So we _underscore_ them. The result reads as _l′_d_.
> We now want a Premiss containing _l_ or _d′_. No. 6 will do.
> These 4 Nullities are really equivalent to (_l′_d_ † _b′_l_). So we underscore _l′_ and _l_. The result reads as _d_b′_.
> We now want a Premiss containing _d′_ or _b_. No. 4 will do.
> Here we underscore _b′_ and _b_. The result reads as _d_e′_.
> We now want a Premiss containing _d′_ or _e_. No. 7 will do.
> Here we underscore _d_ and _d′_. The result reads as _c′_e′_.
> We now want a Premiss containing _c_ or _e_. No. 3 will do—in fact _must_ do, as it is the only one left.
> Here we underscore _c′_ and _c_; and, as the whole thing now reads as _e′_a_, we tack on _e′_a_0 as the _Conclusion_, with a ¶.
> We now look along the row of Data, to see whether _e′_ or _a_ has been given as _existent_. We find that _a_ has been so given in No. 3. So we add this fact to the Conclusion, which now stands as ¶ _e′_a_0 † _a_1, _i.e._ ¶ _a_1_e′_0; i.e. “All _a_ are _e_.”
> If the Reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions, his written solution will now stand as follows:—
> 1_k_1_l′_0 † 2_d_h′_0 † 3_a_1_c_0 † 4_b_1_e′_0 † 5_k′_h_0 † 6_b′_l_0 † 7_d′_1_c′_0
> 1_k_l′_ † 5_k′_h_ † 2_d_h′_ † 6_b′_l_ † 4_b_e′_ † 7_d′_c′_ † 3_a_c_     ¶ _e′_a_0 † _a_1     _i.e._ ¶ _a_1_e′_0;  
> _i.e._ “All _a_ are _e_.”
> The Reader should now take a second piece of paper, and copy the Data only, and try to work out the solution for himself, beginning with some other Premiss.
> If he fails to bring out the Conclusion _a_1_e′_0, I would advise him to take a third piece of paper, and _begin again_!

I will now work out, in its briefest form, a Sorites of 5 Premisses, to serve as a model for the Reader to imitate in working examples.

  ”I greatly value everything that John gives me;

    Nothing but this bone will satisfy my dog;

    I take particular care of everything that I greatly value;

    This bone was a present from John;

    The things, of which I take particular care, are things I do _not_ give to my dog”.

Univ. “things”; _a_ = given by John to me; _b_ = given by me to my dog; _c_ = greatly valued by me; _d_ = satisfactory to my dog; _e_ = taken particular care of by me; _h_ = this bone.

i.e. “Nothing, that I give my dog, satisfies him,” or, “My dog is not satisfied with _anything_ that I give him!”

> Note that, in working a Sorites by this process, we may begin with _any_ Premiss we choose. For instance, we might begin with No. 5, and the result would then be

##### _SOLUTIONS._

##### § 1.

###### _Propositions of Relation reduced to normal form._

###### _Solutions for § 1._

\. The Univ. is “persons.” The Individual “I” may be regarded as a Class, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is “represented by the Name ‘I’”, and may be called the Class of “I’s”. It is evident that this Class cannot possibly contain more than one Member: hence the Sign of Quantity is “all”. The verb “have been” may be replaced by the phrase “are persons who have been”. The Proposition may be written thus:—

“All”

_Sign of Quantity._

“I’s”

_Subject._

“are”

_Copula._

“persons who have been out for a walk”

_Predicate._

or, more briefly,

“All | I’s | are | persons who have been out for a walk”.

\. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 1. The Proposition may be written

“All | I’s | are | persons who feel better”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons from which John is _excluded_; _i.e._ it is the Class containing all persons who are _not_ “John”.

The Sign of Quantity is “no”.

The verb “has read” may be replaced by the phrase “are persons who have read”.

The Proposition may be written

“No | persons who are not ‘John’ | are | persons who have read the letter”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons whose only two Members are “you and I”.

Hence the Sign of Quantity is “no”.

The Proposition may be written

“No | fat creatures | are | creatures that run well”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently the Class of persons who are _not_ brave.

The verb “deserve” may be replaced by the phrase “are deserving of”.

The Proposition may be written

“No | not-brave persons | are | persons deserving of the fair”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The phrase “looks poetical” evidently belongs to the _Predicate_; and the _Subject_ is the Class, of persons, whose peculiar Attribute is “_not_\-pale”.

The Proposition may be written

“No | not-pale persons | are | persons who look poetical”.

\. Univ. is “persons”.

The Proposition may be written

“Some | judges | are | persons who lose their tempers”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The phrase “never neglect” is merely a stronger form of the phrase “am a person who does not neglect”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | ‘I’s’ | are | persons who do not neglect important business”.

\. Univ. is “things”. The phrase “what is difficult” (_i.e._ “that which is difficult” is equivalent to the phrase “all difficult things”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | difficult things | are | things that need attention”.

\. Univ. is “things”. The phrase “what is unwholesome” may be interpreted as in Ex. 10.

The Proposition may be written

“All | unwholesome things | are | things that should be avoided”.

\. Univ. is “laws”. The Predicate is evidently a Class whose peculiar Attribute is “relating to excise”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | laws passed last week | are | laws relating to excise”.

\. Univ. is “things”. The Subject is evidently the Class, of studies, whose peculiar Attribute is “logical”; hence the Sign of Quantity is “all”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | logical studies | are | things that puzzle me”.

\. Univ. is “persons”. The Subject is evidently “persons in the house”.

The Proposition may be written

“No | persons in the house | are | Jews”.

\. Univ. is “dishes”. The phrase “if not well-cooked” is equivalent to the Attribute “not well-cooked”.

The Proposition may be written

“Some | not well-cooked dishes | are | unwholesome dishes”.

\. Univ. is “books”. The phrase “make one drowsy” may be replaced by the phrase “are books that make one drowsy”.

The Sign of Quantity is evidently “all”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | unexciting books | are | books that make one drowsy”.

\. Univ. is “men”. The Subject is evidently “a man who knows what he’s about”; and the word “when” shows that the Proposition is asserted of _every_ such man, _i.e._ of _all_ such men. The verb “can” may be replaced by “are men who can”.

The Proposition may be written

“All | men who know what they’re about | are | men who can detect a sharper”.

\. The Univ. and the Subject are the same as in Ex. 4.

The Proposition may be written

“All | Members of the Class ‘you and I’ | are | persons who know what they’re about”.

### NOTES.

##### (A \ See [p. 80 

One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument, since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e. “Begging the Question”, the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved in _one_ of the Premisses).

This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses taken together, each contributing its share.

Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss _x_m_0 empties the _Inner_ Cell of the N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss _y_m_0 empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion _x_y_0.

Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss _x_m_0 empties the Inner Cell of the N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym1 merely tells us that the Inner Portion of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a ‘I’ in it, _somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to ‘sit on the fence’: it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the _upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place the ‘I’ in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x′y1.

Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that _m_ _exists_, merely authorises us to place a ‘I’ _somewhere_ in the Inner Square——but it has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss _x_m_0 to drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss _y_m_0 to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_ Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and thus to prove the Conclusion _x′_y′_1.

#### ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.

##### § 1.

###### _Introductory._

There are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which nevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many other Methods already published.

These matters are as follows:—

The “Existential Import” of Propositions.  
The use of “is-not” (or “are-not” as a Copula.

The theory “two Negative Premisses prove nothing.”  
Euler’s Method of Diagrams.  
Venn’s Method of Diagrams.  
My Method of Diagrams.  
The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods.  
My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites.  
Some account of Parts II, III.

##### § 2.

###### _The “Existential Import” of Propositions._

The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves——to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope inoffensive title “The Logicians”——take, on this subject, what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak of the Copula of a Proposition “with bated breath”, almost as if it were a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to it.

In opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use. If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his book, “Let it be understood that by the word ‘_black_’ I shall always mean ‘_white_’, and that by the word ‘_white_’ I shall always mean ‘_black_’,” I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think it.

And so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic.

Let us consider certain views that may _logically_ be held, and thus settle which of them may _conveniently_ be held; after which I shall hold myself free to declare which of them _I_ intend to hold.

The _kinds_ of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with “some”, with “no”, and with “all”. These are usually called Propositions “in _I_”, “in _E_”, and “in _A_”.

First, then, a Proposition in _I_ may be understood as asserting, or else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By “existence” I mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two Propositions, “_dreams_ exist” and “_drums_ exist”, denote two totally different kinds of “existence”. A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.)

First, let us suppose that _I_ “asserts” (i.e. “asserts the existence of its Subject”).

Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the _same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_.

We now have _I_ and _A_ “asserting”. Does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to _E_? My answer is “No. We are tied down to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert.” This can be proved as follows:—

If possible, let _E_ “assert”. Then (taking _x_, _y_, and _z_ to represent Attributes we see that, if the Proposition “No _x_y_ are _z_” be true, some things exist with the Attributes _x_ and _y_: i.e. “Some _x_ are _y_.”

Also we know that, if the Proposition “Some _x_y_ are _z_” be true, the same result follows.

But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true. Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e. the Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_” is _always_ true!

_Quod est absurdum._ (See
.

We see, then, that the supposition “_I_ asserts” necessarily leads to “_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not”. And this is the _first_ of the various views that may conceivably be held.

Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ “assert.” And, along with this, let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ “assert.”

Hence the Proposition “No _x_ are _y_” means “Some _x_ exist, and none of them are _y_”: i.e. “_all_ of them are _not_\-_y_,” which is a Proposition in _A_. We also know, of course, that the Proposition “All _x_ are not-_y_” proves “No _x_ are _y_.” Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are _equivalent_. Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in _E_, and therefore “_asserts_”.

Hence our _second_ conceivable view is “_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does not.”

This view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of Logic. But, when we come to _test_ it, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think, that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.

Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones, who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_ principles.

_Author._ “Well, Jones! Have you got your new Club started yet?”

_Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_). “You’ll be glad to hear that some of the Members (mind, I only say ‘_some_’ are millionaires! Rolling in gold, my boy!”

_Author._ “That sounds well. And how many Members have entered?”

_Jones_ (_staring_). “None at all. We haven’t got it started yet. What makes you think we have?”

_Author._ “Why, I thought you said that some of the Members——”

_Jones_ (_contemptuously_). “You don’t seem to be aware that we’re working on strictly _Logical_ principles. A _Particular_ Proposition does _not_ assert the existence of its Subject. I merely meant to say that we’ve made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least _three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year!”

_Author._ “Oh, _that’s_ what you meant, is it? Let’s hear some more of your Rules.”

_Jones._ “Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of forgery, is admissible.”

_Author._ “And here, again, I suppose you don’t mean to assert there _are_ any such convicts in existence?”

_Jones._ “Why, that’s exactly what I _do_ mean to assert! Don’t you know that a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject? _Of course_ we didn’t make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living.”

The Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life. He will, I think, agree with me that Jones’ view, of the ‘Existential Import’ of Propositions, would lead to some inconvenience.

Thirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ “asserts”.

Now the supposition that the two Propositions, “Some _x_ are _y_” and “No _x_ are not-_y_”, do _not_ “assert”, necessarily involves the supposition that “All _x_ are _y_” does _not_ “assert”, since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken separately.

Hence the _third_ (and last of the conceivable views is that neither _I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, “asserts”.

The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition “Some _x_ are _y_” to mean “If there _were_ any _x_ in existence, some of them _would_ be _y_”; and so with _E_ and _A_.

It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the accepted facts of Logic.

Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as valid. Its form is

“All _m_ are _x_;  
  All _m_ are _y_.  
          ∴ Some _y_ are _x_”.

This they would interpret as follows:—

”If there were any _m_ in existence, all of them would be _x_;  
  If there were any _m_ in existence, all of them would be _y_.  
          ∴ If there were any _y_ in existence, some of them would be _x_”.

That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by Mr. Keynes (in his “Formal Logic”, dated 1894, pp. 356, 357), that I prefer to quote his words:—

“_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its predicate._

“Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:—

‘_All M is P_,  
  _All M is S_,  
          _∴ Some S is P_.’

“Taking _S_, _M_, _P_, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the conclusion will imply that, if there is an _S_, there is some _P_. Will the premisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not otherwise.

“The conclusion implies that if _S_ exists _P_ exists; but, consistently with the premisses, _S_ may be existent while _M_ and _P_ are both non-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion, which is not justified by the premisses.”

This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing. Still, “to make sicker”, I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_ Syllogism into a concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_\-logical Reader.

Let us suppose that a Boys’ School has been set up, with the following system of Rules:—

“All boys in the First (the highest Class are to do French, Greek, and Latin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third Class are to do Latin only.”

Suppose also that there _are_ boys in the Third Class, and in the Second; but that no boy has yet risen into the First.

It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any.

We are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two Propositions:—

“If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Greek;  
  If there were any boys doing French, all of them would be doing Latin.”

And the Conclusion, according to “The Logicians” would be

“If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would be doing Greek.”

Here, then, we have two _true_ Premisses and a _false_ Conclusion (since we know that there _are_ boys doing Latin, and that _none_ of them are doing Greek). Hence the argument is _invalid_.

Similarly it may be shown that this “non-existential” interpretation destroys the validity of _Disamis_, _Datisi_, _Felapton_, and _Fresison_.

Some of “The Logicians” will, no doubt, be ready to reply “But we are not _Aldrichians_! Why should _we_ be responsible for the validity of the Syllogisms of so antiquated an author as Aldrich?”

Very good. Then, for the _special_ benefit of these “friends” of mine (with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used! “I must have a private interview with _you_, my young _friend_,” says the bland Dr. Birch, “in my library, at 9 a.m. tomorrow. And you will please to be _punctual_!”), for their _special_ benefit, I say, I will produce _another_ charge against this “non-existential” interpretation.

It actually invalidates the ordinary Process of “Conversion”, as applied to Proposition in ‘_I_’.

_Every_ logician, Aldrichian or otherwise, accepts it as an established fact that “Some _x_ are _y_” may be legitimately converted into “Some _y_ are _x_.”

But is it equally clear that the Proposition “If there _were_ any _x_, some of them _would_ be _y_” may be legitimately converted into “If there _were_ any _y_, some of them would be _x_”? I trow not.

The example I have already used——of a Boys’ School with a non-existent First Class——will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the theory of “The Logicians.”

Let us suppose that there is yet _another_ Rule in this School, viz. “In each Class, at the end of the Term, the head boy and the second boy shall receive prizes.”

This Rule entirely authorises us to assert (in the sense in which “The Logicians” would use the words “Some boys in the First Class will receive prizes”, for this simply means (according to them “If there _were_ any boys in the First Class, some of them _would_ receive prizes.”

Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, “Some boys, who will receive prizes, are in the First Class”, which means (according to “The Logicians” “If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of them _would_ be in the First Class” (which Class we know to be _empty_).

Of this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly _true_: the second, _as_ undoubtedly, _false_.

It is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities him, as a man and a brother, but, as a _cricketer_, one can but pronounce him “Out!”

We see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here considered, there are only _two_ which can _logically_ be held, viz.

_I_ and _A_ “assert”, but _E_ does not.  
_E_ and _A_ “assert”, but _I_ does not.

The _second_ of these I have shown to involve great practical inconvenience.

The _first_ is the one adopted in this book. (See .)

Some further remarks on this subject will be found in .

##### § 3.

###### _The use of “is-not” (or “are-not” as a Copula._

Is it better to say “John _is-not_ in-the-house” or “John _is_ not-in-the-house”? “Some of my acquaintances _are-not_ men-I-should-like-to-be-seen-with” or “Some of my acquaintances _are_ men-I-should-_not_\-like-to-be-seen-with”? That is the sort of question we have now to discuss.

This is no question of Logical Right and Wrong: it is merely a matter of _taste_, since the two forms mean exactly the same thing. And here, again, “The Logicians” seem to me to take much too humble a position. When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the Copula——always a rather fussy ‘heavy father’, asks them “Am _I_ to have the ‘not’, or will you tack it on to the Predicate?” they are much too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, “Leave it to _you_, Sir!” The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a “not” that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that Propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar. Surely it is simpler to treat “Some men are Jews” and “Some men are Gentiles” as being both of them, _affirmative_ Propositions, instead of translating the latter into “Some men are-not Jews”, and regarding it as a _negative_ Propositions?

The fact is, “The Logicians” have somehow acquired a perfectly _morbid_ dread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like frightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as “All not-x are y”; and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of Syllogisms.

Under the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in Dichotomy by Contradiction, the _negative_ part is too large to deal with, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in, or excluded from, the _positive_ part. I see no force in this plea: and the facts often go the other way. As a personal question, dear Reader, if _you_ were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that you _would_ like to be seen with, and men that you would _not_ like to be seen with, do you think the latter group would be so _very_ much the larger of the two?

For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the _same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it “is” in the one, or that it “is” in the other, that I do not think any Reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course.

##### § 4.

###### _The theory that “two Negative Premisses prove nothing”._

This I consider to be _another_ craze of “The Logicians”, fully as morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute.

It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_.

Take the following Pairs of Premisses:—

“None of my boys are conceited;  
  None of my girls are greedy”.

“None of my boys are clever;  
  None but a clever boy could solve this problem”.

“None of my boys are learned;  
  Some of my boys are not choristers”.

This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I should read it “are not-choristers”; but, in dealing with “The Logicians,” I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_ would read it “are-not choristers”.)

If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of them——why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you “will have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy”! \.

##### § 5.

###### _Euler’s Method of Diagrams._

Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_ only. In Euler’s well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the relations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two Classes.

![Diagram of circle x inside circle y](images/append01.png)

Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose respective Attributes are _x_ and _y_, as so related to each other that the following Propositions are all simultaneously true:—“All _x_ are _y_”, “No _x_ are not-_y_”, “Some _x_ are _y_”, “Some _y_ are not-_x_”, “Some not-_y_ are not-_x_”, and, of course, the Converses of the last four.

![Diagram of circle y inside circle x](images/append02.png)

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:—“All _y_ are _x_”, “No _y_ are not-_x_”, “Some _y_ are _x_”, “Some _x_ are not-_y_”, “Some not-_x_ are not-_y_”, and, of course, the Converses of the last four.

![Diagram of two separate circles x and y](images/append03.png)

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:—“All _x_ are not-_y_”, “All _y_ are not-_x_”, “No _x_ are _y_”, “Some _x_ are not-_y_”, “Some _y_ are not-_x_”, “Some not-_x_ are not-_y_”, and the Converses of the last four.

![Diagram of two intersecting circles x and y](images/append04.png)

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:—“Some _x_ are _y_”, “Some _x_ are not-_y_”, “Some not-_x_ are _y_”, “Some not-_x_ are not-_y_”, and of course, their four Converses.

Note that _all_ Euler’s Diagrams assert “Some not-_x_ are not-_y_.” Apparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be true!

Now, to represent “All _x_ are _y_”, the _first_ of these Diagrams would suffice. Similarly, to represent “No _x_ are _y_”, the _third_ would suffice. But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_ Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all the possible cases), and, for “Some not-_x_ are not-_y_”, all the _four_.

##### § 6.

###### _Venn’s Method of Diagrams._

Let us represent “not-_x_” by “_x′_”.

Mr. Venn’s Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method.

He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired relation between _x_ and _y_, by simply shading a Compartment known to be _empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_.

Thus, he would represent the three Propositions “Some _x_ are _y_”, “No _x_ are _y_”, and “All _x_ are _y_”, as follows:—

![Venn diagram representing x y exists](images/append05.png)

![Venn diagram representing x y does not exist](images/append06.png)

![Venn diagram representing all x are y](images/append07.png)

It will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are _x_y_, _x_y′_, _x′_y_, and _x′_y′_, only _three_ are here provided with closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the Infinite Plane to range about in!

This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever attempted to represent “No _x′_ are _y′_.” Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281 encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion, by the simple foot-note “We have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram”!

To represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term _together_, a _three_\-letter Diagram is needed. This is the one used by Mr. Venn.

![Venn diagram of three intersecting circles x y and z](images/append08.png)

Here, again, we have only _seven_ closed Compartments, to accommodate the _eight_ Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are _x_y_m_, _x_y_m′_, &c.

“With four terms in request,” Mr. Venn says, “the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner”. This, however, provides only _fifteen_ closed compartments.

![Venn diagram of four intersecting ellipses a b c and d](images/append09.png)

For _five_ letters, “the simplest diagram I can suggest,” Mr. Venn says, “is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the _outside_ of _c_; i.e. its four component portions are inside _b_ and _d_ but are no part of _c_). It must be admitted that such a diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations—nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32 combinations involved.”

![Venn diagram of five intersecting ellipses a b c d and e and an interior ellipse](images/append10.png)

This Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments.

For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams, like the above, one for the _f_\-part, and the other for the not-_f_\-part, of all the other combinations. “This”, he says, “would give the desired 64 subdivisions.” This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments, and _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, _a′_b′_c′_d′_e′_f_ and _a′_b′_c′_d′_e′_f′_, would have to share between them.

Beyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go.

##### § 7.

###### _My Method of Diagrams._

My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn’s, in having separate Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his Method, in assigning a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so that the Class which, under Mr. Venn’s liberal sway, has been ranging at will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself “cabin’d, cribb’d, confined”, in a limited Cell like any other Class! Also I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark an _occupied_ Cell with a ‘I’ (meaning that there is at least _one_ Thing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a ‘O’ (meaning that there is _no_ Thing in it).

For _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is assigned to ‘_x_’, the South to ‘not-_x_’ (or ‘_x′_’), the West to _y_, and the East to _y′_. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the _x_y_\-Class, the N.E. Cell the _x_y′_\-Class, and so on.

![Empty biliteral diagram](images/append11.png)

For _three_ letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an _Inner_ Square, which I assign to _m_, the _Outer_ Border being assigned to _m′_. I thus get _eight_ Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes, whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are _x_y_m_, _x_y_m′_, &c.

![Empty triliteral diagram](images/append12.png)

This last Diagram is the most complex that I use in the _Elementary_ Part of my ‘Symbolic Logic.’ But I may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II.

For _four_ letters (which I call _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ I use this Diagram; assigning the North Half to _a_ (and of course the _rest_ of the Diagram to _a′_), the West Half to _b_, the Horizontal Oblong to _c_, and the Upright Oblong to _d_. We have now got 16 Cells.

![Empty quadriliteral diagram](images/append13.png)

For _five_ letters (adding e I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous Diagram by _oblique_ partitions, assigning all the _upper_ portions to _e_, and all the _lower_ portions to _e′_. Here, I admit, we lose the advantage of having the _e_\-Class all _together_, “in a ring-fence”, like the other 4 Classes. Still, it is very easy to find; and the operation, of erasing it, is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other Class. We have now got 32 Cells.

![Empty pentaliteral diagram](images/append14.png)

For _six_ letters (adding _h_, as I avoid _tailed_ letters I substitute upright crosses for the oblique partitions, assigning the 4 portions, into which each of the 16 Cells is thus divided, to the four Classes _e_h_, _e_h′_, _e′_h_, _e′_h′_. We have now got 64 Cells.

For _seven_ letters (adding _k_ I add, to each upright cross, a little inner square. All these 16 little squares are assigned to the _k_\-Class, and all outside them to the _k′_\-Class; so that 8 little Cells (into which each of the 16 Cells is divided are respectively assigned to the 8 Classes _e_h_k_, _e_h_k′_, &c. We have now got 128 Cells.

For _eight_ letters (adding _l_ I place, in each of the 16 Cells, a _lattice_, which is a reduced copy of the whole Diagram; and, just as the 16 large Cells of the whole Diagram are assigned to the 16 Classes abcd, abcd′, &c., so the 16 little Cells of each lattice are assigned to the 16 Classes ehkl, ehkl′, &c. Thus, the lattice in the N.W. corner serves to accommodate the 16 Classes _a_b_c′_d′_e_h_k_l_, _a_b_c′_d′_e_h′_k_l′_, &c. This Octoliteral Diagram (see  next page contains 256 Cells.

For _nine_ letters, I place 2 Octoliteral Diagrams side by side, assigning one of them to _m_, and the other to _m′_. We have now got 512 Cells.

###### _Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods._

The best way, I think, to exhibit the differences between these various Methods of solving Syllogisms, will be to take a concrete example, and solve it by each Method in turn. Let us take, as our example,  No. 29](#ex5q29 (see [p. 102 

“No philosophers are conceited;  
  Some conceited persons are not gamblers.  
  ∴ Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers.”

  _Solution by ordinary Method._

These Premisses, as they stand, will give no Conclusion, as they are both negative.

If by ‘Permutation’ or ‘Obversion’, we write the Minor Premiss thus,

‘Some conceited persons are not-gamblers,’

we can get a Conclusion in _Fresison_, viz.

“No philosophers are conceited;  
  Some conceited persons are not-gamblers.  
  ∴ Some not-gamblers are not philosophers”

This can be proved by reduction to _Ferio_, thus:—

“No conceited persons are philosophers;  
  Some not-gamblers are conceited.  
  ∴ Some not-gamblers are not philosophers”.

The validity of _Ferio_ follows directly from the Axiom ‘_De Omni et Nullo_’.

  _Symbolic Representation._

Before proceeding to discuss other Methods of Solution, it is necessary to translate our Syllogism into an _abstract_ form.

Let us take “persons” as our ‘Universe of Discourse’; and let _x_ = “philosophers”, _m_ = “conceited”, and _y_ = “gamblers.”

Then the Syllogism may be written thus:—

“No _x_ are _m_;  
  Some _m_ are _y′_.  
  ∴ Some _y′_ are _x′_.”

  _Solution by Euler’s Method of Diagrams._

The Major Premiss requires only _one_ Diagram, viz.

![Diagram representing x m does not exist](images/append18.png)

The Minor requires _three_, viz.

![Diagram representing y m does not exist](images/append19.png)

![Diagram representing y m exists](images/append20.png)

![Diagram representing all y are m](images/append21.png)

The combination of Major and Minor, in every possible way requires _nine_, viz.

Figs. 1 and 2 give

![Diagram representing no x y or x m or y m exist](images/append22.png)

![Diagram representing x m and y m do not exist and x y exists](images/append23.png)

![Diagram representing x and y are identical and x m does not exist](images/append24.png)

![Diagram representing x m does not exist and all y are x](images/append25.png)

![Diagram representing y m does not exist and all x are y](images/append26.png)

Figs. 1 and 3 give

![Diagram representing no x y or x m exist and y m exists](images/append27.png)

![Diagram representing no x are m and x y and y m exist](images/append28.png)

![Diagram representing all x are y and y m exists and x m does not exist](images/append29.png)

Figs. 1 and 4 give

![Diagram representing no x are y and all m are y](images/append30.png)

From this group (Figs. 5 to 13 we have, by disregarding _m_, to find the relation of _x_ and _y_. On examination we find that Figs. 5, 10, 13 express the relation of entire mutual exclusion; that Figs. 6, 11 express partial inclusion and partial exclusion; that Fig. 7 expresses coincidence; that Figs. 8, 12 express entire inclusion of _x_ in _y_; and that Fig. 9 expresses entire inclusion of _y_ in _x_.

We thus get five Biliteral Diagrams for _x_ and _y_, viz.

![Diagram representing x y does not exist](images/append31.png)

![Diagram representing x y exists](images/append32.png)

![Diagram representing x and y are identical](images/append33.png)

![Diagram representing all x are y](images/append34.png)

![Diagram representing all y are x](images/append35.png)

where the only Proposition, represented by them all, is “Some not-_y_ are not-_x_,” i.e. “Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers”——a result which Euler would hardly have regarded as a _valuable_ one, since he seems to have assumed that a Proposition of this form is _always_ true!

  _Solution by Venn’s Method of Diagrams._

The following Solution has been kindly supplied to me Mr. Venn himself.

”The Minor Premiss declares that some of the constituents in _m_y′_ must be saved: mark these constituents with a cross.

![Venn diagram of three intersecting circles](images/append36.png)

The Major declares that all _x_m_ must be destroyed; erase it.

Then, as some _m_y′_ is to be saved, it must clearly be _m_y′_x′_. That is, there must exist _m_y′_x′_; or eliminating _m_, _y′_x′_. In common phraseology,

‘Some _y′_ are _x′_,’ or, ‘Some not-gamblers are not-philosophers.’”

  _Solution by my Method of Diagrams._

The first Premiss asserts that no _x_m_ exist: so we mark the _x_m_\-Compartment as empty, by placing a ‘O’ in each of its Cells.

The second asserts that some _m_y′_ exist: so we mark the _m_y′_\-Compartment as occupied, by placing a ‘I’ in its only available Cell.

![Diagram representing x m does not exist and y prime m exists](images/append37.png)

The only information, that this gives us as to _x_ and _y_, is that the _x′_y′_\-Compartment is _occupied_, i.e. that some _x′_y′_ exist.

Hence “Some _x′_ are _y′_”: i.e. “Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers”.

  _Solution by my Method of Subscripts._

_x_m_0 † _m_y′_1 ¶ _x′_y′_1

i.e. “Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers.”

###### _My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites._

Of all the strange things, that are to be met with in the ordinary text-books of Formal Logic, perhaps the strangest is the violent contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two subjects. While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_ different forms of _Syllogisms_——each with its own special and exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored——they have limited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these they have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed!

As to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_ forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given at  p. 101 

As to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are the _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in _A_, so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and the _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written backwards. Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling fact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the order of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites. If we assume (as surely we may? that he is the _same_ man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think it was has said of Tupper, viz., “here is a man who, beyond all others of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!”

These puerile——not to say infantine——forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them, for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular Syllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with _any one_ of them he likes.

I have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the Premisses of the Aristotelian Sorites

 All _a_ are _b_;  
 All _b_ are _c_;  
 All _c_ are _d_;  
 All _d_ are _e_;  
 All _e_ are _h_.  
  ∴ All _a_ are _h_.

may be syllogistically arranged, and I find there are no less than _sixteen_ such orders, viz., 12345, 21345, 23145, 23415, 23451, 32145, 32415, 32451, 34215, 34251, 34521, 43215, 43251, 43521, 45321, 54321. Of these the _first_ and the _last_ have been dignified with names; but the other _fourteen_——first enumerated by an obscure Writer on Logic, towards the end of the Nineteenth Century——remain without a name!

##### § 10.

###### _Some account of Parts II, III._

In Part II. will be found some of the matters mentioned in this Appendix, viz., the “Existential Import” of Propositions, the use of a _negative_ Copula, and the theory that “two negative Premisses prove nothing.” I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing Propositions containing alternatives (such as “Not-all _x_ are _y_”), Propositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as “All _a_b_ are _c_”, which, taken along with “Some _b_c′_ are _d_”, would prove “Some _d_ are _a′_”), &c. I shall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very_ puzzling subjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas. I hope, in the course of Part II., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used in our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve Problems of the same kind as, and far harder than, those that are at present set in their Examinations.

In Part III. I hope to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way subjects, some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises I have met with. In this Part will be found such matters as the Analysis of Propositions into their Elements (let the Reader, who has never gone into this branch of the subject, try to make out for himself what _additional_ Proposition would be needed to convert “Some _a_ are _b_” into “Some _a_ are _b_c_”), the treatment of Numerical and Geometrical Problems, the construction of Problems, and the solution of Syllogisms and Sorites containing Propositions more complex than any that I have used in Part II.

I will conclude with eight Problems, as a taste of what is coming in Part II. I shall be very glad to receive, from any Reader, who thinks he has solved any one of them (more especially if he has done so _without_ using any Method of Symbols), what he conceives to be its complete Conclusion.

It may be well to explain what I mean by the _complete_ Conclusion of a Syllogism or a Sorites. I distinguish their Terms as being of two kinds——those which _can_ be eliminated (e.g. the Middle Term of a Syllogism), which I call the “Eliminands,” and those which _cannot_, which I call the “Retinends”; and I do not call the Conclusion _complete_, unless it states _all_ the relations among the Retinends only, which can be deduced from the Premisses.

All the boys, in a certain School, sit together in one large room every evening. They are of no less than _five_ nationalities——English, Scotch, Welsh, Irish, and German. One of the Monitors (who is a great reader of Wilkie Collins’ novels is very observant, and takes MS. notes of almost everything that happens, with the view of being a good sensational witness, in case any conspiracy to commit a murder should be on foot. The following are some of his notes:—

  Whenever some of the English boys are singing “Rule Britannia”, and some not, some of the Monitors are wide-awake;

  Whenever some of the Scotch are dancing reels, and some of the Irish fighting, some of the Welsh are eating toasted cheese;

  Whenever all the Germans are playing chess, some of the Eleven are _not_ oiling their bats;

After the six friends, named in Problem 5, had returned from their tour, three of them, Barry, Cole, and Dix, agreed, with two other friends of theirs, Lang and Mill, that the five should meet, every day, at a certain _table d’hôte_.

  If Barry takes salt, then either Cole or Lang takes _one_ only of the two condiments, salt and mustard: if he takes mustard, then either Dix takes neither condiment, or Mill takes both.

  If Cole takes salt, then either Barry takes only _one_ condiment, or Mill takes neither: if he takes mustard, then either Dix or Lang takes both.

### NOTES TO APPENDIX.

##### (A \ See [p. 167, line 6 

It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that the argument, here applied to the Propositions _I_ and _E_, will apply equally well to the Propositions _I_ and _A_ (since, in the ordinary text-books, the Propositions “All _x_y_ are _z_” and “Some _x_y_ are not _z_” are regarded as Contradictories). Hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows:—

“We now have _I_ and _A_ ‘asserting.’ Hence, if the Proposition ‘All _x_y_ are _z_’ be true, some things exist with the Attributes _x_ and _y_: i.e. ‘Some _x_ are _y_.’

“Also we know that, if the Proposition ‘Some _x_y_ are not-_z_’ be true the same result follows.

“But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of them _must_ be true. Hence this result is always true: i.e. the Proposition ‘Some _x_ are _y_’ is _always_ true!

“_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert.”

This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_ and _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books, is untenable. The proof is as follows:—

With regard to the relationship existing between the Class ‘_x_y_’ and the two Classes ‘_z_’ and ‘not-_z_’, there are _four_ conceivable states of things, viz.

Some _x_y_

are _z_,

and

some

are not-_z_;

〃

〃

none

〃

No _x_y_

〃

some

〃

〃

〃

none

〃

Of these four, No. (2 is equivalent to “All _x_y_ are _z_”, No. (3 is equivalent to “All _x_y_ are not-_z_”, and No. (4 is equivalent to “No _x_y_ exist.”

Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three _must_ be false.

Hence the Contradictory to (2 is “Either (1 or (3 or (4 is true.” Now the assertion “Either (1 or (3 is true” is equivalent to “Some _x_y_ are not-_z_”; and the assertion “(4 is true” is equivalent to “No _x_y_ exist.” Hence the Contradictory to “All _x_y_ are _z_” may be expressed as the Alternative Proposition “Either some _x_y_ are not-_z_, or no _x_y_ exist,” but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition “Some _y_ are not-_z_.”        ) ) 
##### (B \ See [p. 171, at end of Section 2 

There are yet _other_ views current among “The Logicians”, as to the “Existential Import” of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in this Section.

One is, that the Proposition “some _x_ are _y_” is to be interpreted, neither as “Some _x_ _exist_ and are _y_”, nor yet as “If there _were_ any _x_ in existence, some of them _would_ be _y_”, but merely as “Some _x_ _can be_ _y_; i.e. the Attributes _x_ and _y_ are _compatible_”. On _this_ theory, there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones “Some of your brothers are swindlers”; since, if he indignantly retorted “What do you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel?”, I should calmly reply “I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_——that some of your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers”. But it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones!

Another view is, that the Proposition “All _x_ are _y_” _sometimes_ implies the actual _existence_ of _x_, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_ interpretation we are to give to it. _This_ view is, I think, strongly supported by common usage; and it will be fully discussed in Part II: but the difficulties, which it introduces, seem to me too formidable to be even alluded to in Part I, which I am trying to make, as far as possible, easily intelligible to mere _beginners_.

##### (C \ See [p. 173, § 4 

The three Conclusions are

“No conceited child of mine is greedy”;  
“None of my boys could solve this problem”;  
“Some unlearned boys are not choristers.”

###  Transcriber's Note

This book contains a large number of line drawn illustrations which are un-credited. These did not reproduce well in this medium and have been re-drawn electronically as close as possible to the original. A number of transcription errors were found in the original book. As these were clearly not part of the Author’s intention they have, as far as possible, been identified and corrected in accordance with the methods given by the Author. These corrections have also been marked with an underline as e.g. construct, so that the original text may be seen by hovering the mouse cursor over the corrected element. In these notes the word ‘natural’ identifies a letter symbol occurring without a prime mark.

In the original book at the top of page 97, the following text occurred: N.B. The numbers at the foot of each page indicate the pages where the corresponding matter may be found. In accordance with the un-paged medium here this has been changed to: N.B. Reference tags for Examples, Answers & Solutions will be found in the right margin.

The part of the book to which this relates contains, by sections, “Examples” (Exercises for the student), “Answers” (to the Examples & “Solutions” (Worked Answers). All Example sections have corresponding Answer sections. For Sections 2 & 3, worked Solutions are not supplied; for Sections 4–7, Solutions are given by 2 different methods. In association with this, the original text contained editorial notes at the foot of each page giving the page numbers for the related Sections. In this version, these notes are replaced with hyperlinks: for each Section the marginal marker which is given at the top of the Section identifies the current location and by clicking on it the reader is taken on a round tour of the related Sections.
