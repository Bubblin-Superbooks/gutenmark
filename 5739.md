0\. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other  
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone  
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without  
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,  
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get  
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for  
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative  
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It  
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft  
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free  
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free  
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the  
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;  
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or  
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License  
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.  

1\. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a  
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed  
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any  
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is  
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the  
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with  
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of  
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the  
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject  
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly  
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a  
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any  
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical  
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,  
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding  
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles  
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice  
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,  
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that  
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,  
represented in a format whose specification is available to the  
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and  
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of  
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available  
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or  
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input  
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file  
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage  
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is  
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain  
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML  
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple  
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include  
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only  
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or  
processing tools are not generally available, and the  
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output  
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,  
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material  
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in  
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means  
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,  
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.  

2\. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either  
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the  
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies  
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other  
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use  
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further  
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept  
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough  
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and  
you may publicly display copies.  

3\. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,  
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose  
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover  
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on  
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify  
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present  
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and  
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.  
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve  
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated  
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit  
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit  
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent  
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering  
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent  
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy  
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete  
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the  
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no  
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter  
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin  
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this  
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location  
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque  
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to  
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the  
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give  
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.  

4\. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under  
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release  
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified  
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution  
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy  
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct  
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions  
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section  
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version  
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities  
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified  
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the  
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).  

---
#### C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the  
   Modified Version, as the publisher.  

---
#### D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.  
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications  
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.  
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice  
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the  
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections  
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.  

---
#### I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to  
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and  
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If  
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one  
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as  
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified  
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.  
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for  
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise  
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions  
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at  
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original  
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.  
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",  
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the  
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements  
   and/or dedications given therein.  

---
#### L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,  
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers  
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.  

---
#### M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section  
   may not be included in the Modified Version.  
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"  
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or  
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material  
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all  
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the  
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.  
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains  
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various  
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has  
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a  
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a  
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list  
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of  
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or  
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already  
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or  
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,  
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit  
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License  
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or  
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.  

5\. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this  
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified  
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the  
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and  
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its  
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and  
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single  
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but  
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by  
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original  
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of  
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"  
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled  
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",  
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections  
entitled "Endorsements."  

6\. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents  
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this  
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in  
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for  
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute  
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this  
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all  
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.  

7\. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate  
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or  
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version  
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the  
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this  
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled  
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they  
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these  
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter  
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on  
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.  
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.  

8\. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may  
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special  
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include  
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the  
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a  
translation of this License provided that you also include the  
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement  
between the translation and the original English version of this  
License, the original English version will prevail.  

9\. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except  
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to  
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will  
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,  
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this  
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such  
parties remain in full compliance.  

10\. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions  
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new  
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may  
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See  
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.  
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this  
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of  
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or  
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the  
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version  
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not  
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of  
the License in the document and put the following copyright and  
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.  
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document  
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1  
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;  
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the  
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU  
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"  
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no  
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of  
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we  
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of  
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,  
to permit their use in free software.

�±ر� ��п�� the national flag of Korea, the Tai-geuk flag  
The Korean flag is called T\\ae{gukgi. It's design symbolizes  
the principles of yin and yang in Oriental philosophy.  
The circle in the center of the flag is divided into two equal  
parts. The upper red section represents the positive cosmic forces of  
yang. Conversely, the lower blue section represents the negative  
cosmic forces of yin.

The two forces together embody the concepts of continual  
movement and balance and harmony that characterize the sphere  
of infinity. The circle is surrounded by four trigrams in each

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook
files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook
Files by December 31, 2001.  \[10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion\]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
\[Employee Identification Number\] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

You can get up to date donation information online at:

If you can't reach Project Gutenberg,
you can always email directly to:

Michael S. Hart Prof. Hart will answer or forward your message.

We would prefer to send you information by email.
